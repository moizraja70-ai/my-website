# SECTION B: EPIDEMIOLOGY

## 1. BASIC DEFINITIONS

### Health
- **WHO Definition (1948)**: "A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"
- **Ecological Concept**: Health is a dynamic equilibrium between human organism and environment

### Disease
- **Definition**: A condition of the body or its parts in which the functions are disturbed or deranged
- **Spectrum of Disease**: Range from subclinical cases → mild illness → severe illness → fatal illness

### Epidemiology
- **Definition (John M Last)**: "Study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems"
