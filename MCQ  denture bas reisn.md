### **✅ SECTION 1: EASY (Fundamental Concepts & Definitions)**

*Direct recall of definitions, standard values, and basic functions across all topics.*

1. **By definition, the procedure of "rebasing" a complete denture involves:**  
   A. Resurfacing only the tissue-contacting surface to improve fit.  
   B. Replacing the entire denture base material while retaining the original teeth.  
   C. Replacing the posterior teeth to restore vertical dimension.  
   D. Adding a soft liner to the existing hard base.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Rebasing replaces the entire structural (pink) acrylic, keeping only the teeth.

2. **The chemical agent added to the monomer liquid specifically to prevent premature polymerization during storage is:**  
   A. Benzoyl peroxide.  
   B. A tertiary amine.  
   C. Hydroquinone.  
   D. Glycol dimethacrylate.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** Hydroquinone acts as the inhibitor to extend shelf life.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** They lose their plasticizers rapidly, becoming hard and rough after about two weeks.

4. **Ideally, the acrylic dough should be packed into the flask during which stage of polymer-monomer interaction?**  
   A. Sandy  
   B. Stringy  
   C. Dough  
   D. Rubbery

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** The dough stage is pliable, moldable, and non-tacky, allowing adaptation without trapping air.

5. **Which component is typically found in the powder of a heat-cure acrylic resin system to act as the initiator?**  
   A. Methyl methacrylate monomer.  
   B. Dibutyl phthalate.  
   C. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO).  
   D. Dimethyl-p-toluidine.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** BPO is the initiator located in the polymer powder.

6. **The primary clinical indication for a reline procedure is to:**  
   A. Repair a fractured denture base.  
   B. Restore lost vertical dimension due to tooth wear.  
   C. Improve the adaptation of the denture base to a resorbed ridge.  
   D. Change the esthetic shade of the denture base.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** Relining resurfaces the intaglio to compensate for ridge resorption.

7. **The boiling point of methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer, a critical threshold during processing, is approximately:**  
   A. 74°C  
   B. 100.8°C  
   C. 125°C  
   D. 150°C

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Exceeding this temperature causes monomer to vaporize, leading to gaseous porosity.

8. **A Which material is commonly applied to the gypsum mold surface as a separating medium, preventing monomer penetration into the stone and water contamination of the resin?**

                       **A. Benzoyl peroxide paste**  
                         **B. Sodium alginate solution**  
                              **C. Hydroquinone liquid**  
                                   **D. Glycol dimethacrylate coating**

**✅ Correct Answer: B — Sodium alginate solution**

### **Why B is correct (structured)**

**Purpose of a separating medium (gypsum → resin):**

* **Blocks monomer (MMA) from soaking into porous stone**

* **Prevents water from stone contaminating the resin mix**

* **Helps easy separation after polymerization and improves surface finish**


**Answer: A**  
**Reason:** It creates a barrier. Without it, water affects polymerization, and monomer soaking into stone creates a rough, adherent surface.

9. **In a chemically activated (self-cure) resin system, what is required to trigger the decomposition of the initiator at room temperature?**  
   A. External heat above 60°C.  
   B. Exposure to intense blue light.  
   C. A tertiary amine activator in the liquid monomer.  
   D. An excess of hydroquinone inhibitor.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** The tertiary amine chemically activates the BPO without needing heat.

10. **The "intaglio" surface of a denture refers specifically to the:**  
    A. Polished outer surface facing the cheeks/lips.  
    B. Occlusal surface of the teeth.  
    C. Surface that makes contact with the underlying oral tissues.  
    D. Peripheral border seal area.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** Intaglio is the tissue-bearing surface.

11. **Which agent is added to denture base resins to cross-link polymer chains, thereby improving resistance to surface crazing?**  
    A. Dibutyl phthalate.  
    B. Glycol dimethacrylate.  
    C. Sodium alginate.  
    D. Titanium dioxide.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Dimethacrylates have two double bonds, allowing them to link different polymer chains together into a network.

12. **The generally accepted standard polymer-to-monomer mixing ratio by volume is:**  
    A. 2 parts polymer to 1 part monomer.  
    B. 3 parts polymer to 1 part monomer.  
    C. 1 part polymer to 1 part monomer.  
    D. 4 parts polymer to 1 part monomer.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** This 3:1 ratio provides enough liquid to wet the beads while minimizing total shrinkage.

13. **The primary function of a long-term soft liner is to:**  
    A. Permanently rebase a ill-fitting denture.  
    B. Act as a shock absorber to cushion sensitive tissues.  
    C. Chemically bond to the alveolar bone.  
    D. Prevent fungal colonization.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Soft liners are resilient, distributing masticatory impact to protect underlying tissues.

14. **What is the activator in a conventional heat-cured acrylic resin system?**  
    A. Thermal energy (heat).  
    B. Benzoyl peroxide.  
    C. Tertiary amine.  
    D. Visible light.

**Answer: A**  
**Reason:** Heat is the energy source required to break down the BPO initiator.

15. **Compared to porcelain teeth, acrylic resin denture teeth have the advantage of being:**  
    A. More wear-resistant.  
    B. Capable of chemical bonding to the denture base.  
    C. More abrasive to opposing natural teeth.  
    D. "Clicky" sounding during chewing.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Resin teeth chemically fuse with the PMMA base; porcelain relies only on mechanical retention.

### **✅ SECTION 2: INTERMEDIATE (Processing variables & Material Science)**

*Understanding the "why" and "how" of materials and lab steps across topics.*

16. **Heat-cured PMMA generally has better biocompatibility than self-cured PMMA because heat processing achieves:**  
    A. A smoother surface finish that repels bacteria.  
    B. Complete neutralization of the inhibitor.  
    C. A higher degree of conversion.  
    D. A lower glass transition temperature.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** Residual monomer is a tissue irritant. Heat cure leaves \~0.2-0.5% residual monomer, while self-cure leaves \~3-5%.

17. **If a technician packs the acrylic mold during the "rubbery" stage, the final denture will likely fit poorly because:**  
    A. The material is too sticky and traps air bubbles.  
    B. The material rebounds when compressed, preventing accurate adaptation.  
    C. The monomer has already evaporated, leading to a granular mix.  
    D. The cross-linking process has already completed.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** The rubbery stage is characterized by elasticity, making compression molding inaccurate due to spring-back.

18. **The aIf methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer were polymerized on its own without the addition of pre-polymerized PMMA powder, the volumetric shrinkage would be approximately:**  
    **A. 0.5% B. 2–3% C. 6–7% D. 21%**  
    **Answer: D Reason: Pure monomer undergoes massive density changes during conversion, shrinking \~21% by volume. The addition of the pre-shrunk powder (in a 3:1 ratio) reduces this volumetric shrinkage to approximately 6–7% (which clinically manifests as \~0.5% linear shrinkage).**  
      
19. **Why does a short-term tissue conditioner eventually become hard and rough in the mouth?**  
    A. It continues to polymerize due to body heat.  
    B. Plasticizers leach out of the material into saliva over time.  
    C. Salivary enzymes cause additional cross-linking.  
    D. It absorbs excessive amounts of water, causing swelling.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** These materials rely on leachable plasticizers for their softness. As these are lost, the material hardens.

20. **To ensure a strong chemical bond between acrylic denture teeth and a heat-cured base, it is essential to:**  
    A. Coat the ridge-lap surface of the teeth with separating medium.  
    B. Ensure the ridge-lap surface is clean and free of wax residue.  
    C. Use porcelain teeth instead of resin teeth.  
    D. Rough the surface of the teeth with a coarse bur.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Wax contamination prevents the base monomer from penetrating and solvating the tooth surface, blocking the chemical bond.

21. **A mix of resin with too little monomer (a dry mix) will result in a cured denture base that is:**  
    A. Highly prone to gaseous porosity in thick sections.  
    B. Granular and weak because the polymer beads were not fully wetted and fused.  
    C. More flexible due to lack of cross-linking.  
    D. More esthetic due to reduced transparency.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Sufficient monomer is needed to dissolve surface polymer and weld the beads together into a solid matrix.

22. **The "bench cure" step (letting the packed flask rest before heating) is important because it allows time for:**  
    A. The rapid escape of all trapped air.  
    B. Pressure equalization and uniform diffusion of monomer throughout the mold.  
    C. The monomer to reach its boiling point.  
    D. The hydroquinone inhibitor to evaporate completely.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** This resting period ensures a homogeneous mix and improves bonding with resin teeth.

23. **Self-cured resins are inherently more porous than heat-cured resins primarily because they are usually processed:**  
    A. At temperatures above 100°C.  
    B. Without high packing pressure to compress trapped air bubbles.  
    C. With insufficient initiator in the powder.  
    D. Using a very large particle size for the polymer beads.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Mixing always traps air. In heat curing, high pressure makes these bubbles invisible. Self-cure (especially repairs) often lacks this pressure.

24. **To minimize the risk of gaseous porosity in a very thick mandibular denture, the best curing protocol is:**  
    A. A rapid boil cycle (100°C immediately).  
    B. A long, slow cure at a temperature below 100°C (e.g., 74°C for 8 hours).  
    C. Curing in a microwave at max power.  
    D. Using double the amount of inhibitor in the mix.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Thick sections trap exothermic heat. A low external temperature keeps the total internal temperature (bath temp \+ exotherm) below the monomer's boiling point.

25. **The "stringy" stage of mixing occurs because:**  
    A. The polymer beads have completely dissolved into liquid.  
    B. Monomer attacks the bead surfaces, causing polymer chains to uncoil and become tacky.  
    C. Water sorption from the air makes the mix sticky.  
    D. The cross-linking agent is beginning to gel.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Partially dissolved polymer chains on the bead surfaces entangle and stick to instruments, forming strings.

**Question:**  
 Long-term silicone soft liners frequently fail clinically due to the growth of *Candida albicans* within the liner’s pores and:

A. Failure of adhesion (delamination) between the silicone and the PMMA base  
 B. Rapid leaching of plasticizers causing hardening  
 C. Dissolution of the silicone material by alcoholic beverages  
 D. Excessive expansion due to water sorption

✅ **Correct Answer: A — Failure of adhesion (delamination)**

### **Why A is correct (structured)**

**Main clinical failure pattern (long-term silicone liners):**

**Porosity/rough surface → Candida colonization** (common hygiene-related issue)

**Weak bond to denture base → delamination at the silicone–PMMA interface** (major mechanical failure)

**Mechanism (why bonding fails):**

**Silicone is hydrophobic \+ chemically inert**

**PMMA denture base is different chemically** (poor natural chemical affinity)

The bond relies heavily on **primers/adhesives**, which can weaken over time with:

1. **water exposure \+ thermal cycling**

   2. **flexure during function**

   3. **microleakage at the interface**

   Result: **edge lifting → peeling → full separation (delamination**

28. **Immediately after processing, a new acrylic denture has the highest potential to cause chemical irritation because:**  
    A. Water absorption is at its peak rate.  
    B. The rate of residual monomer leaching is highest initially.  
    C. The surface roughness is maximum before wear occurs.  
    D. The separating medium film is still present.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Residual monomer diffuses out over time. The concentration gradient is highest right after processing, leading to the fastest leaching.

28. **Why is auto-polymerizing resin preferred over heat-cured resin for most chairside denture repairs?**  
    A. It yields a stronger final repair.  
    B. It prevents warping of the existing denture base by avoiding high external heat.  
    C. It results in zero residual monomer.  
    D. It bonds chemically better to old acrylic.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Reheating a cured denture near its softening point releases "frozen-in" processing stresses, causing distortion. Self-cure avoids this.

29. **A simple clinical method to reduce residual monomer in a new denture before delivery is to:**  
    A. Store it dry for 24 hours.  
    B. Soak it in water for at least 24 hours.  
    C. Briefly boil it in water.  
    D. Polish the intaglio surface heavily.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Water immersion allows residual monomer to diffuse out of the denture base.

30. **Using an excess of monomer liquid in the mix will lead to a cured denture with:**  
    A. Less polymerization shrinkage.  
    B. Increased potential for porosity and higher shrinkage.  
    C. Higher impact strength.  
    D. A faster setting time.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** More monomer means more material that shrinks and generates heat (exotherm risk), increasing porosity potential.

### **✅ SECTION 3: HARD (Defect Analysis & Causal Reasoning)**

*Diagnosing problems based on appearance, history, or specific mechanisms.*

31. **A atient reports a denture looks “foggy/hazy”. Exam shows a network of minute hair-line cracks on the surface, but denture is still intact. Patient soaks it nightly in alcohol-based mouthwash.**

**Question: This surface defect is best classified as:**  
 **A. Gaseous porosity**  
 **B. Crazing**  
 **C. Contraction porosity**  
 **D. Surface warpage**

**✅ Correct Answer: B — Crazing**

### **Why B is correct (structured)**

**Definition (key term):**  
 **Crazing \= formation of fine superficial microcracks (hair-line cracks) in acrylic resin, giving a whitish / hazy / foggy appearance.**

**Why it happens here (mechanism):**

* **Denture base (PMMA) contains residual/internal stresses (processing \+ function)**

* **Organic solvents (alcohol) can penetrate PMMA**

* **Alcohol acts as a stress-cracking agent:**

  * **softens/separates polymer chains locally**

  * **accelerates stress relief at the surface**

* **Result: surface microcrack network → haze, but no gross fracture**

  ### **Why the other options are wrong (quick)**

* **A Gaseous porosity: internal voids/bubbles from processing; not a surface crack network.**

* **C Contraction porosity: shrinkage voids (often internal/thicker areas), not hair-line surface cracks.**

* **D Surface warpage: distortion/change in shape or fit, not a crack pattern.**

**One-line exam memory:**  
 ***Hazy denture \+ hair-line surface cracks \+ alcohol/solvent soaking → Crazing.***

32. 

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Organic solvents weaken secondary bonds between chains, causing stress cracking (crazing).

32. **A heat-cured maxillary denture shows spherical porosity bubbles confined only to the thickest mid-palatal area. Thin areas are clear. This was likely caused by:**  
    A. Underpacking the mold.  
    B. Using too much monomer in the mix.  
    C. The internal temperature of thick sections exceeding 100.8°C due to heat buildup.  
    D. Failure to apply separating medium.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** This is classic gaseous porosity. Thick sections cannot dissipate exothermic heat, leading to localized boiling of monomer.

33. **If a lab technician overpacks the flask (too much dough) and fails to achieve metal-to-metal closure, the resulting clinical error will be:**  
    A. An increase in the vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO).  
    B. Severe porosity throughout the base.  
    C. A denture base that is too thin and weak.  
    D. Teeth that are sunk too deeply into the base.

**Answer: A**  
**Reason:** The excess acrylic creates a thicker denture base than the wax pattern, opening the bite.

34.   
     **A denture repair re-fractures at the bond interface after \~4 months. Patient frequently drinks alternating hot and cold beverages.**

**Question: Primary failure mechanism is:**  
 **A. Hydrolytic degradation**  
 **B. Thermal incompatibility**  
 **C. Monomer leaching**  
 **D. Plasticizer loss**

**✅ Correct Answer: B — Thermal incompatibility**

### **Why B is correct (structured)**

**What “thermal incompatibility” means (in repairs):**

* **Mismatch in Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) between:**

  * **Old denture base (PMMA)**

  * **New repair resin (may have different formulation/CTE)**

**Mechanism of failure (hot–cold cycling):**

1. **Hot drink → both materials expand**

2. **Cold drink → both contract**

3. **If their CTEs differ, they change dimension at different rates**

4. **This creates repeated interfacial shear stresses at the repair joint**

5. **Over time → fatigue of the bond → delamination/re-fracture at interface**

**Reason:** Thermal cycling causes expansion/contractio

35. **A processed A processed denture shows large, irregular voids scattered randomly throughout the entire base. This porosity is most likely due to:**

**A. Monomer boiling (gaseous porosity)**  
 **B. Insufficient pressure during polymerization (contraction porosity)**  
 **C. Excessive use of cross-linker**  
 **D. Rapid cooling after curing**

**✅ Correct Answer: B — Insufficient pressure during polymerization (Contraction porosity)**

### **Why B is correct (structured)**

**Key pattern recognition:**

* **Contraction porosity \= irregular, non-spherical voids that can be widespread**

* **Caused by polymerization shrinkage without adequate compensation**

**Mechanism:**

* **During curing, resin shrinks as monomer converts to polymer**

* **If packing pressure is inadequate (or flask closure is poor / pressure not maintained), the shrinking mass is not kept compressed**

* **Result: voids open up throughout the base → large, irregular porosity**

  ### **How this differs from gaseous porosity (A)**

* **Gaseous porosity (monomer boiling) is typically:**

  * **round/spherical**

  * **mostly in thick sections (where temperature rises most)**

  * **often localized rather than scattered everywhere**

36. **A patient presents with a complete denture that no longer fits. Upon questioning, the patient admits to soaking the denture in boiling water to "kill bacteria." The resulting permanent distortion of the prosthesis is best classified as:**

**Question: This permanent distortion is best classified as:**  
 **A. Crazing**  
 **B. Warpage**  
 **C. Porosity**  
 **D. Expansion**

**✅ Correct Answer: B — Warpage**

### **Why B is correct (structured)**

**Definition (key term):**  
 **Warpage \= a permanent change in shape (distortion) of the denture base → loss of fit.**

**Mechanism (why boiling water causes it):**

* **Boiling water raises PMMA temperature toward/into a range where it softens (near its glass transition behavior)**

* **Softened polymer chains can move and relieve “frozen-in” internal stresses from processing**

* **Once cooled, the denture “sets” in the new distorted shape → permanent misfit \= warpage**

  ### **Why the other options are wrong (quick)**

* **A Crazing: microcrack network causing hazy surface, not gross distortion.**

* **C Porosity: voids/bubbles, not change in shape.**

* **D Expansion: temporary dimensional change; the key here is permanent distortion.**

**One-liner (exam):**  
 ***Boiling water \+ acrylic denture → stress release \+ softening → permanent distortion \= Warpage***

37. **A soft liner improves retention of a mandibular denture specifically by its ability to:**  
    A. Chemically bond to oral mucosa.  
    B. Flex to engage moderate soft-tissue undercuts without trauma.  
    C. Reduce salivary surface tension.  
    D. Absorb water and swell to fill voids.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** The resiliency allows it to deform into and out of undercuts that a rigid base cannot engage.

38. **To prevent irreversible distortion (warpage) of the existing denture base during a repair, it is most critical that the repair resin does NOT exhibit an excessive:**

**A. Polymerization shrinkage**  
 **B. Exothermic reaction**  
 **C. Water sorption rate**  
 **D. Elastic modulus**

**✅ Correct Answer: B — Exothermic Reaction**

### **Why B is correct (structured)**

**Core idea: Warpage happens when the old denture base softens and its internal (frozen-in) stresses get released.**

**Mechanism:**

* **Auto-polymerizing repair resins generate heat during setting (exothermic polymerization)**

* **If the exotherm is excessive, it can heat the surrounding PMMA base close to its softening range (glass transition behavior)**

* **This allows polymer chains in the old base to move, releasing stresses**

* **Result: permanent shape change → warpage**

39. you are struggling to deflask a newly processed denture. When you finally retrieve it, the base is rough and pieces of dental stone are tenaciously bonded to the acrylic. You ask the technician for an explanation, and they reply, "You clearly forgot the most important step before packing."  
    **Question:** What step did you miss?  
     A. Soaking the stone cast in water  
     B. Applying the sodium alginate separating medium  
     C. Performing a trial closure with a plastic sheet  
     D. Allowing the flask to bench cure  
    ✅ **Correct Answer: B — Applying the sodium alginate separating medium**

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Without separator, liquid resin penetrates the stone mold and polymerizes, interlocking the two materials.

40. **A patient who leaves their denture dry on a nightstand every night notices it feels loose after a few months and has surface cracks. This is primarily caused by:**  
    A. UV light degradation.  
    B. Fatigue from repeated cycles of water sorption (expansion) and desorption (contraction).  
    C. Leaching of the inhibitor.  
    D. Continued polymerization shrinkage.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** PMMA acts like a sponge. Constant wetting and drying cycles fatigue the material, leading to crazing and warpage.

41. **The inclusion of cross-linking agents in PMMA improves resistance to solvent-induced crazing by:**  
    A. Increasing water sorption to dilute solvents.  
    B. Tying polymer chains together with covalent bridges, preventing solvents from wedging them apart.  
    C. Increasing the amount of residual monomer.  
    D. Lowering the molecular weight of the polymer.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Cross-links form a 3D network that resists the penetration and swelling action of solvents.

42. **After laboratory processing, a remount reveals an anterior open bite that was not present during the try-in. The flash was thick during packing. The error was:**  
    A. Underpacking.  
    B. Overpacking resulting in incomplete flask closure.  
    C. Excessive thermal shrinkage.  
    D. Warpage due to rapid cooling.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** A thick flash indicates excess material prevented the flask halves from meeting, thickening the denture base and opening the bite.

43. **For a patient with a sharp, knife-edge mandibular ridge that causes chronic pain under a hard denture, the best material-based solution is:**  
    A. A chairside hard reline.  
    B. A heat-processed long-term soft liner to act as a cushion.  
    C. Continuous use of tissue conditioners.  
    D. Using a stronger denture adhesive.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** A long-term soft liner provides durable shock absorption to distribute forces over the sensitive ridge.

44. **A repaired mandibular denture fits the cast perfectly but is too narrow intraorally, pinching the ridges. The repair involved a wide midline fracture. The cause is:**  
    A. Expansion of the repair stone.  
    B. Polymerization shrinkage of the large mass of repair acrylic pulling the flanges inward.  
    C. Thermal contraction of the old base.  
    D. Water absorption by the repair material.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** A large volume of repair resin across the arch will shrink significantly, narrowing the distance between the buccal flanges.

45. **The potential for chemical irritation from a new denture is highest in the first 24 hours because:**  
    A. Water sorption is maximal.  
    B. The rate of residual monomer leaching is highest due to the steep concentration gradient.  
    C. The surface is roughest.  
    D. Saliva has not yet coated the denture.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Unreacted monomer diffuses out most rapidly immediately after processing.

### **✅ SECTION 4: IMPOSSIBLY HARD CLINICAL LOGIC (Integrative Scenarios)**

*Multi-step reasoning, diagnosis, and treatment planning involving various materials.*

46. **Case:** A patient cleans their partial denture (with a cobalt-chromium framework) by soaking it in dilute bleach overnight. After two weeks, the metal framework appears dark and tarnished.  
    **The mechanism of this failure is:**  
    A. Acrylic expansion leading to stress on the metal.  
    B. Hypochlorite acting as an oxidizing agent, causing corrosion of the base metal alloy.  
    C. Leaching of hydroquinone staining the metal.  
    D. Reaction of bleach with the polishing compounds.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Hypochlorite (bleach) is highly corrosive to non-precious metals used in partial denture frameworks.

47. **Case:** A patient requests a reline for a loose 12-year-old denture. Examination reveals the porcelain teeth are worn flat, vertical dimension is lost, and the base is heavily stained.  
    **The most appropriate definitive treatment is:**  
    A. Reline the denture chairside.  
    B. Rebase the denture to replace the stained base.  
    C. Fabricate a new complete denture.  
    D. Place a long-term soft liner to compensate for wear.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** The denture is functionally obsolete (worn teeth, lost VDO) and esthetically failed (stained base). Reline/rebase cannot fix tooth wear.

48. **Case:** A patient complains of a burning mouth immediately during a chairside hard reline procedure using self-curing acrylic.  
    **The most likely cause of this acute symptom is:**  
    A. Systemic toxicity of hydroquinone.  
    B. Thermal irritation from the exothermic heat of polymerization in the mouth.  
    C. Rapid water sorption causing pinching.  
    D. An allergic reaction to the cross-linker.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Self-cure acrylics generate significant heat while setting, which can burn mucosa if bulk amounts are left intraorally.

49. **Case:** A patient has severe denture stomatitis under an old upper denture. You plan a new denture but must improve tissue health first.  
    **The appropriate immediate material intervention is:**  
    A. A heat-processed long-term silicone liner.  
    B. Application of a tissue conditioner (short-term soft liner), changed weekly.  
    C. A hard chairside acrylic reline.  
    D. Prescribing analgesic mouthwash only.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Tissue conditioners act as soft healing dressings to allow inflamed tissues to recover before final impressions.

50. **Case:** A new maxillary denture fits well initially but the patient returns in one week complaining of soreness on the mid-palate and rocking. The intaglio surface of the thick palate area is rough with small spherical voids.  
    **The most likely lab error responsible is:**  
    A. Underpacking the mold.  
    B. Overheating during processing, causing monomer boiling in the thick section.  
    C. Failure to use separating medium.  
    D. Using too much polymer powder in the mix.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** The signs (spherical voids in thick area, roughness) are diagnostic of gaseous porosity due to excessive heat, leading to a high spot and rocking.

51. **Case:** A patient with poor hygiene has a long-term soft liner that smells foul and has white patches that don't brush off.  
    **The diagnosis and mechanism are:**  
    A. Chemical degradation by saliva.  
    B. *Candida albicans* colonization within the porous structure of the aged liner.  
    C. Residual monomer burn causing tissue necrosis.  
    D. Food impaction in surface crazing caused by alcohol.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Soft liners become porous and are difficult to clean, making them ideal substrates for fungal growth and associated odor.

52. **Case:** A denture base is sound, teeth show minimal wear, and occlusion is good, but the patient needs increasing amounts of adhesive to keep it in due to ridge resorption.  
    **The best treatment is:**  
    A. Rebase the denture.  
    B. Reline the denture.  
    C. Make a new denture.  
    D. Permanently increase adhesive use.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Only the fit to the tissues is defective due to resorption. A reline corrects this without replacing the good base and teeth.

53. **Case:** A lab technician repairs a midline fracture using "salt-and-pepper" self-cure resin without a pressure pot.  
    **The resulting clinical outcome will most likely be:**  
    A. A repair that is stronger than the original base.  
    B. Significant warpage of the denture.  
    C. A porous, weak repair that discolors easily.  
    D. Failure of the repair to bond.

**Answer: C**  
**Reason:** Without pressure to compress incorporated air bubbles, the repair will be full of voids (porosity).

54. **Case:** A patient uses abrasive toothpaste aggressively on their acrylic denture for months. They now have chronic stomatitis despite antifungal use.  
    **The material-based reason for persistent infection is:**  
    A. The abrasive has created a deeply scratched, rough surface that harbors biofilm and fungus and is impossible to clean.  
    B. The toothpaste chemicals are irritating the tissue.  
    C. The toothpaste sealed the surface porosity.  
    D. The abrasive thinned the base, making it flexible.

**Answer: A**  
**Reason:** Rough surfaces promote heavy microbial colonization that resists standard cleaning and medication.

55. **Case:** A student packs dough that is still in the "stringy" stage. The final denture shows poor adaptation and internal voids.  
    **This occurred because the stringy material:**  
    A. Had too much elastic rebound.  
    B. Was too sticky to pack without trapping air and flowed poorly into details.  
    C. Had already begun excessive shrinkage.  
    D. Was too fluid and leaked out of the flask.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** The stringy stage is too tacky and lacks the plasticity needed for proper compression molding.

56. **Case:** A denture base appears porous throughout, with a dry, granular look. The lab notes indicate the mix seemed "dry" before packing.  
    **The cause is:**  
    A. Excess monomer.  
    B. Insufficient monomer to wet and fuse all the polymer beads.  
    C. Rapid heating cycle.  
    D. Lack of bench curing.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** A dry mix means beads are not fused by a monomer matrix, resulting in a weak, grainy, porous structure (contraction porosity).

57. **Case:** A patient with a long-term silicone soft liner asks how to clean it daily. To prevent damage and control fungus, you recommend:  
    A. Overnight soak in hypochlorite bleach.  
    B. Gentle brushing with mild soap and soaking in a specific liner-safe cleanser (avoiding harsh oxidizers).  
    C. Daily soak in alcohol mouthwash.  
    D. Scrubbing vigorously with hard brush and toothpaste.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Bleach damages liners; alcohol causes crazing; harsh brushing causes roughness. Gentle mechanical \+ mild chemical cleaning is safest.

58. **Case:** A repaired denture warps after the technician cures the self-cure repair resin in hot water.  
    **The warpage occurred because the heat:**  
    A. Caused excessive water sorption.  
    B. Raised the temperature of the old base near its glass transition (Tg), releasing locked-in processing stresses.  
    C. Decomposed the repair initiator.  
    D. Melted the wax on the cast.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** Heating cured PMMA softens it enough for internal strains to relax, distorting the shape.

59. **Case:** An old denture has a fractured flange, is heavily stained, and is porous, but the teeth are good.  
    **The best treatment option is:**  
    A. Reline.  
    B. Rebase.  
    C. New Denture.  
    D. Repair fracture only.

**Answer: B**  
**Reason:** The base is defective structurally and esthetically, but teeth are sound. Replace the base (rebase).

60. **Case:** After deflasking, a denture is polished aggressively with a dry wheel, generating high heat. The denture subsequently rocks in the mouth.  
    **The mechanism is:**  
    A. Localized frictional heat softened the acrylic, allowing stress release and warpage.  
    B. The polishing removed too much material from the borders.  
    C. The heat caused rapid evaporation of residual monomer.  
    D. The vibration broke the bond to the teeth.

**Answer: A**  
**Reason:** Frictional heat can easily reach the Tg of PMMA, causing localized distortion.
