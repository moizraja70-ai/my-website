Before We Start: How to Think About “Properties”
To use dental materials safely and intelligently, we first need:
1. Clear definitions
○ What each property actually means (strength, toughness, rheology,
solubility, etc.).
2. Clinical correlation (the more important part)
○ How that property affects:
■ Operative (restorations, liners, composites)
■ Ortho (wires, adhesives)
■ Prostho (impressions, cements, denture bases, crowns)
This may feel like a lot of theory, but the goal is simple:
Know the few key properties that actually change how you select, handle, and
evaluate materials in the clinic—and the way they are asked in exams.
MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
The fundamental relationship between force and deformation.
1) Stress (σ)
Definition:
Stress is the internal resistance of a material to an external load.
When an external force is applied, the material “pushes back” internally to maintain its
structure—this internal reaction is stress.
Formula (Docs-friendly):
Stress = Force / Area
Written as:
σ = F / A

-- 1 of 29 --

Units:
● Pascal (Pa)
● Megapascal (MPa)
● Common dental unit: MPa = N/mm²
Clinical example:
1. When a patient bites on a restoration, the biting force is distributed over the restoration’s
surface area, creating stress within the material. If the force is concentrated over a very
small area (stress concentration), the stress becomes very high and may overload the
restoration or tooth structure, leading to fracture of the restoration or even a cusp.
2. So clinically, we try to avoid excessively high stress by improving occlusal contacts
and distributing forces evenly.
1. Denture note (occlusal table):
If a denture tooth has a very large (wide) occlusal table, the chewing load is less efficient
and tends to increase lateral/tipping forces. This can lead to poor cutting/biting efficiency
and may destabilize the denture (more tipping/rocking). Therefore, denture teeth are
often designed with a more appropriate occlusal table width to improve efficiency and
stability.
2. However: If the occlusal table is made too narrow, the same chewing force is applied
over a smaller contact area, which can increase the pressure transmitted to the
denture-bearing tissues. This may concentrate load on the mucosa/gingiva (especially if
the denture is unstable), leading to tissue soreness and sore spots.
3. Clinical principle: Aim for an occlusal table width that balances chewing efficiency
and denture stability while avoiding excessive stress concentration on the supporting
tissues.

2.Strain (ε)
Definition: The amount of deformation (change in shape) that
occurs in response to stress.
When a material is subjected to stress, it physically changes dimensions (stretches,
compresses, or twists). Strain measures this change relative to the original length.
• Formula: Strain (ε) = ΔL / L₀
– ΔL = change in length
– L₀ = original length
• Units: Dimensionless (often expressed as a percentage, %).
•Dental bridge example:
If a dental bridge bends slightly in the middle under chewing forces, the force from chewing is
the stress, and the bending/deformation of the bridge is the strain.
● Impression material / “chewing gum” analogy:
When you pull an impression material (or something elastic like chewing gum), the

-- 3 of 29 --

pulling force you apply is the stress, and the material elongating/stretching is the
strain.
One-line rule to remember:
Stress = the load you apply (cause).
Strain = the deformation that happens (effect).
3. The Stress-Strain Curve Zones
The Stress–Strain Relationship
Stress (σ) causes strain (ε).
A stress–strain curve shows how a material deforms as you increase the load.
We uses a metal diagram showing if u applies the stress on a material what phases it
undergoes on a stress strain curve

-- 4 of 29 --

Elastic Region (The "Spring" Zone):
1.Elastic Modulus (Stiffness): slope of the elastic (linear) part of the stress–strain curve =
Modulus of Elasticity (E).
This tells you how rigid (stiff) or flexible a material is.
● Higher E (steeper slope) = more rigid / stiffer
→ very little strain (bending) for a given stress.
Example idea:Porcelain / glass-like materials are extremely stiff, so they don’t bend
much.
● Lower E (less steep slope) = more flexible
→ more strain (bending) for the same stress.
Example: metals with lower E flex more.
● It is the stiffness of the material — i.e., how much it bends/strains for a given stress.
■ High Modulus: Rigid (e.g., PFM Metal Framework).
■ Low Modulus: Flexible (e.g., Class V filling to flex with the tooth)

-- 5 of 29 --

2.Resilience = area under the curve in the elastic region only
3.proportional limit:
The highest point on the stress–strain curve where stress is directly proportional to
strain (the end of the perfectly straight/linear region).
After this point:
The curve stops being perfectly linear, so stress and strain no longer have a constant
proportional relationship (Hooke’s law no longer strictly applies).
Why we care about this because this affects modulus of elasticity and we care about that alot
Why it matters clinically
1. Predictable deflection (using E)
● Below the proportional limit, stress ∝ strain, so calculations based on E are accurate.
● Above it, the curve becomes nonlinear, so E no longer predicts bending/deflection
reliably.
2. Safety margin for “springback” behavior
● For things that must act like springs (wires, clasps), you want them to work within the
proportional/elastic range.
● A higher proportional limit means the material can take more stress while still
behaving elastically/linearly.
3. Early warning before permanent distortion
● The proportional limit is usually close to the onset of non-ideal behavior that leads
toward plastic deformation.
● In frameworks/bridges/wires, once you start leaving the linear elastic range, you risk
distortion, loss of fit, or fatigue.
So if Straight line (stress and strain increase together evenly) = safe → material springs
back.
Line starts to curve = warning → you may be near yield, so stop to avoid permanent bend.

-- 6 of 29 --

Simple one-liner
E tells you “how stiff.” The proportional limit tells you “how far you can load it and still
trust that stiffness and get a clean springback.”
Elastic limit: the maximum stress a material can take and still return completely to its
original shape when the load is removed.
● Below elastic limit: returns to original shape (no permanent change).
● Beyond elastic limit: permanent deformation occurs → it will not fully return to its
original position.
(Elastic limit is basically the boundary between elastic and plastic behavior.)
It's pretty hard to see in metals so we use another terminology called the yield strength
Yield Strength (σy)
Definition: The stress required to produce 0.2% permanent (plastic) strain (also called
0.2% proof stress
1) Modulus of Elasticity (E) and “Stiffness” in Dental
Alloys
High E = stiffer (less bending)
Low E = more flexible (more bending)
1) Base-metal alloys (very stiff)
● Cobalt–Chromium (Co–Cr) → very high stiffness
● Nickel–Chromium (Ni–Cr) → very high stiffness
Clinical meaning: frameworks can be thinner and still resist flexing.
2) Stainless steel (stiff)
● Used in orthodontics; still high stiffness, but generally discussed more as a wire
material.

-- 7 of 29 --

3) Noble alloys (less stiff than base metals)
Noble alloys = high noble (gold-rich) or palladium-based alloys.
● Gold alloys (Type III/IV, high noble) → lower modulus than Co–Cr / Ni–Cr
● Palladium-based noble alloys → moderate to high modulus, but in many dental
teaching comparisons, base metals are still stiffer.
Clinical meaning:
If you use a gold/high-noble framework, it may need to be bulkier/thicker than a base-metal
framework to achieve the same rigidity (same “no-flex” behavior).
Orthodontic Wires: Stiffness (E) vs Springback (Resilience)
Common wire stiffness order (for similar size wires)
● Stainless steel = stiff
● Beta-titanium (TMA) = moderate stiffness
● NiTi = low stiffness, but high springback (resilience)
Key clinical idea:
● NiTi: bends easily but springs back strongly → best for initial alignment with light
continuous forces.
● Stainless steel: stiff control → best for working/finishing, detailing, sliding
mechanics.
● TMA: middle ground and easy to bend → good for loops and adjustments.
How wire stiffness changes with radius (ORTHO
SPECIFIC)
When you change the thickness of a wire, stiffness changes a LOT.
A) Bending stiffness (like when a wire flexes up/down)

-- 8 of 29 --

Bending stiffness ∝ E × r⁴ (for a round wire)
So radius is to the 4th power (super sensitive).
Quick memory examples:
● If radius doubles → stiffness increases 2⁴ = 16×
● If diameter doubles → stiffness also increases 16× (because diameter ∝ radius)
Even small changes matter:
● Increase radius by 10% → stiffness ≈ (1.1)⁴ ≈ 1.46 → about 46% stiffer
B) Axial stiffness (pulling along its length)
Axial stiffness ∝ E × r²
(less dramatic than bending)
C) Torsional stiffness (twisting)
For a round wire, torsional stiffness also scales strongly with size (commonly taught as ∝ r⁴).
To make it simple if u increase the radius if the wire is twice as thicker it will be 16 times hard to
bend 4 times hard to pull it and 16 times harder to twist it
That's why when we were making adams clasp from a 0.7mm wire it was so difficult on the
other hand finger spring and z spring were so easy as they were 0.5mm wire

-- 9 of 29 --

Wire thickness (radius) effect — super important rule
For a round wire, thickness affects stiffness a LOT:
● If the radius doubles (wire becomes twice as thick):
○ Bending stiffness becomes 16× higher (r⁴) → 16× harder to bend
○ Pulling (axial) stiffness becomes 4× higher (r²) → 4× harder to stretch/pull
○ Twisting (torsional) stiffness becomes 16× higher (r⁴) → 16× harder to twist
One-line memory:
Small increase in wire thickness → huge increase in bending and twisting stiffness (r⁴).
One-line summary
● E (modulus) = stiffness (how much it bends).
● Base metals (Co–Cr, Ni–Cr) are very stiff; gold/noble alloys are less stiff → need
more bulk for the same rigidity.
● Orthodontic wires: Stainless steel stiff, TMA medium, NiTi low stiffness but high
springback.
● Wire thickness rule: bending stiffness ∝ r⁴ → small increase in radius makes wire
much stiffer.
2)Resilience (elastic energy storage)
Definition: The energy a material can absorb and store in the elastic range (i.e., without
permanent deformation) and then release when the load is removed.

-- 10 of 29 --

Where on the stress–strain curve:
● Resilience = area under the curve in the elastic region only
● Practically: up to the yield point / elastic limit
● This is the “blue shaded area” in many diagrams.
Meaning (simple):
It is the energy absorbed before permanent deformation begins.
So is it “energy required to permanently bend something”?
Not exactly.
● Resilience = energy absorbed up to the start of permanent bending (yield).
how much energy a material can absorb and still be “unaffected”
Energy that can absorbed and return or its original position
Clinical example:
● Mouthguards: need high resilience so they can absorb impact and spring back (no
permanent deformation).
Orthodontic wire examples (Resilience / “springback”)
● NiTi (Nickel–Titanium) — early alignment
○ Very high springback / high resilience
○ Can be deflected a lot in crowded teeth and still returns
○ Gives light, more constant forces over a long activation range
● TMA / Beta-titanium — mid-stage, loops & bends
○ Moderate springback (between NiTi and stainless steel)
○ Easier to bend than NiTi, good for loops and adjustments

-- 11 of 29 --

○ Useful when you want flexibility + ability to customize
● Stainless steel — working/finishing
○ High stiffness (high modulus) → less deflection
○ Lower springback than NiTi
○ Best for control, detailing, sliding mechanics, and maintaining arch form
One-line memory:
NiTi = maximum springback → TMA = workable + moderate springback → Stainless steel
= stiff control,
One-line memory:
Resilience = elastic energy before yield.

-- 12 of 29 --

Plastic Region (The "Dent" Zone):
3)Yield Strength (σy)
Definition: The amount of stress required to start permanent (plastic) deformation.
Yield Strength: The exact point where the material stops springing back and
permanently deforms. If a bridge passes this point, it is ruined.
Why we use “0.2% yield strength” (proof stress)
Plastic deformation (permanent strain) starts gradually in many metals, so there isn’t always a
sharp, obvious “yield point” on the stress–strain curve. Also, the first tiny amount of permanent
strain is hard to detect directly.
So we define a measurable standard: 0.2% yield strength (0.2% proof stress).
● It is the stress required to produce 0.2% permanent (plastic) strain.
● 0.2% strain = 0.002 (as a decimal).
● Method (conceptually): draw a line parallel to the elastic slope, but shifted to start at
0.2% strain on the x-axis; where it meets the curve is the 0.2% yield strength.
Meaning:
At stresses below this value → deformation is mostly elastic (material springs back).
At stresses at/above this value → the material has measurable permanent deformation.
Clinical link:
If a bridge/framework is stressed beyond its yield strength (especially the 0.2% proof value), it
can become permanently distorted → misfit, open margins, occlusal issues.
If a material has low yield strength meaning less strength is required to bend it
It tells how easily it bends do not confuse with modulus of elasticity which is how much it bends
Important distinction (so you don’t mix terms):
● Yield strength (σy) tells you how easily it permanently bends.
● Modulus (E) tells you how much it elastically bends before permanent change.

-- 13 of 29 --

One-line example:
A wire with low yield strength will get permanently bent with a smaller load compared to a
wire with high yield strength.
Why not call it “plastic deformation”?
Because plastic deformation is the result (how much permanent strain occurred), while yield
strength is the cause threshold (how much stress is needed to cause a standard amount of
permanent strain).
Because the exact start of plastic deformation can be unclear, we use the yield strength (often
0.2% proof stress) to define the onset of plastic deformation on the stress–strain curve.”
Clinically we want every material to have a very large yield point so that it is very hard to ruin it
or deform it
In most clinical situations, higher yield strength is “safer” because it means the material is
harder to permanently bend or distort.
Why higher yield strength is usually better:
● Needs more stress before permanent deformation starts
● Maintains fit, margins, occlusion, and appliance shape under chewing/handling
forces
● Reduces risk of distortion in frameworks and wires
Where this matters most (high priority):
● Bridges / PFM frameworks / RPD frameworks
● Implant bars/frameworks
● Working/finishing orthodontic wires (stainless steel)
But the correct exam line is:
“Higher yield strength is generally preferred, provided other required properties are also met
(e.g., stiffness/modulus, toughness, corrosion resistance, workability).”
One-line memory:
Higher yield strength = harder to permanently bend = more clinically durable shape

-- 14 of 29 --

UTS (Ultimate Tensile Strength)
Definition: The maximum stress a material can withstand in tension before it starts to fail.
On a stress–strain curve, it is the highest point (peak) of the curve.
What happens after UTS (metals):
● After reaching UTS, the material begins necking (local thinning).
● Then the stress the sample can carry drops until fracture.
The maximum tensile stress a material can withstand before fracture.
Clinical meaning (dentistry):
● High UTS = the material can withstand higher tensile stress before it fractures.
● Relevant for: bridges/frameworks, orthodontic wires, cast/forged metals, and any
component under pulling/bending forces.
Remember:
● Yield strength = stress where permanent bending starts
● UTS = stress where the material reaches its maximum strength before necking/fracture
Definition: Toughness is the total energy a material absorbs before it fractures.
On the stress–strain curve: it is the total area under the entire curve (elastic + plastic parts)
up to fracture.
Meaning (simple):
“The total amount of energy required to break something.”
Do NOT confuse with fracture toughness:
● Toughness = overall energy absorption until fracture (bulk behavior).
● Fracture toughness = resistance to crack propagation (behavior when a crack/defect
is present).

-- 15 of 29 --

Examples (dentistry):
● Zirconia: relatively tough for a ceramic (more crack-resistant, harder to break than
many ceramics).
● Porcelain: brittle (low energy absorption; tends to crack/shatter suddenly).
Fracture Toughness (KIC)
Definition:
Fracture toughness is a material’s resistance to crack growth (crack propagation).
It tells you how hard it is for an existing crack to spread and cause sudden failure.
Why it matters:
In real life, materials often contain tiny flaws or microcracks. A material can have high
strength, but if its fracture toughness is low, a small crack can rapidly grow and the material can
fracture catastrophically.
How to think of it (simple):
● High fracture toughness: cracks tend to stop or grow slowly → more
damage-tolerant
● Low fracture toughness: cracks run fast → brittle, sudden fracture

-- 16 of 29 --

On a stress–strain curve:
Fracture toughness is not the same as “area under the curve.”
● Area under curve = toughness (energy to fracture)
● Fracture toughness = crack resistance
Units (common): MPa√m
Dental relevance examples (conceptual):
● Glass/porcelain: low fracture toughness → cracks spread easily
● Metals: high fracture toughness → cracks are less likely to run suddenly
● Zirconia: higher fracture toughness than many ceramics (crack resistance is
improved)(HOW in ceramic )
One-line memory:
Fracture toughness = resistance to crack propagation.
Other Mechanical Properties
1) Tensile Strength
Definition: The maximum stress a material can withstand when being pulled before it fractures.
(Usually refers to UTS on the stress–strain curve.)
Example: Orthodontic wires must resist tensile/bending forces without breaking.
Even though amalgam is a metal, it is much stronger in compression than in tension.
So thin or unsupported margins/edges are prone to fracture, which is why amalgam
restorations need adequate bulk minimum of 1.5 mm and well-supported cavity design
Dental ceramics and enamel are strong in compression but weak in tension.

-- 17 of 29 --

Typically brittle materials are weak in tensile strength but strong in compression
reasoning in ceramics
2) Compressive Strength
Definition: The maximum stress a material can withstand when being compressed
(pushed/squeezed) before it crushes or fails.
Example: Dental ceramics and enamel perform well under compression.
Amalgam is strong in compression but weaker in tension (so thin edges can fracture if
unsupported).
Most materials are stronger in compression than in tension, because tensile forces open
cracks/defects, while compression tends to close them.
Metals are stronger in both
3) Impact Strength

-- 18 of 29 --

Definition: The ability of a material to absorb sudden shock/impact energy without fracturing.
(Related to toughness under rapid loading.)
Impact Strength (examples)
● Mouthguards should have high impact strength so they can absorb sudden blows
without cracking.
For restorations Impact strength (shock resistance) tends to be:
Resin composite > Amalgam > Glass ionomer cement (GIC)
Why
● Composite (higher impact strength): polymer resin matrix can absorb and dissipate
energy, and crack growth is slowed by fillers/resin bonding → less “shattering.”
● Amalgam (lower impact strength than composite): it’s relatively brittle in tension
with limited ability to absorb sudden energy → thin/unsupported parts can chip/fracture.
● GIC (low impact strength): more brittle (glass + ionic matrix) → cracks propagate
easily, so it fractures with sudden удар/shock.
One-line note:
Composite = more shock-resistant; Amalgam and GIC = more brittle (especially GIC
Low impact strength materials (brittle)
● Dental ceramics have low impact strength → they can chip or fracture if dropped or
struck.
● Denture base acrylic (PMMA) has lower impact strength than mouthguard
materials, so dentures can fracture if dropped, especially on hard surfaces.
Impact strength tells us whether a material will break or not when a large amount of
energy is applied very quickly.”
Simple comparison (for memory)
● Toughness:

-- 19 of 29 --

“Total energy to break it (slow or fast).”
● Impact strength:
“How well it survives a sudden blow.”
When we try to break something like a stick or something we try to do in in a fast jerk if
we do it slowly it dosent break as smoothly
4) Ductility
Definition: The ability of a material to undergo plastic deformation in tension (can be drawn
into wire) before fracture.
Measured by % elongation or reduction in area.
Example: Metals used for wires and bending procedures need good ductility.
Gold — especially pure/annealed gold (gold foil) — is considered the most ductile dental
material (can be stretched/drawn without breaking).
How we measure it:
● % elongation (how much it lengthens before breaking)
● % reduction in area
Simple meaning :
“How much a wire can be stretched (permanently) before it breaks.”
Important note:
This is about plastic stretch before fracture, not just elastic stretch.
This is pulling force

-- 20 of 29 --

5) Malleability
Definition: The ability of a material to undergo plastic deformation in compression (can be
hammered/rolled into sheets) without cracking.
Example: Gold is the most ductile and highly malleable (can be made into thin foils/sheets).
This is pushing force or compression force

-- 21 of 29 --

6) Brittleness
Definition:
Brittleness is the tendency of a material to fracture suddenly with little or no plastic
deformation.
Simple meaning:
“It breaks without bending.”glass like
On the stress–strain curve:
● Very small plastic region (almost no “dent zone”)
● Low strain at fracture
● Low toughness (small area under curve)

-- 22 of 29 --

Related properties:
● Brittle materials usually have low fracture toughness (cracks spread easily).
● Brittle ≠ soft. A material can be hard but brittle (e.g., ceramics).
Dental examples (brittle):
● Porcelain / dental ceramics
● Enamel (brittle compared to dentin)
● Glass ionomer cement (GIC)
● Denture porcelain teeth (more brittle than resin teeth)
Less brittle (more ductile/energy-absorbing):
● Metals (gold alloys, stainless steel, Co–Cr, Ni–Cr)
● Resin composites (generally tougher than ceramics)
Clinical importance:
Brittle materials should not be left thin or unsupported → they crack/chip easily.
So we use: adequate thickness + rounded internal line angles + good support (avoid
sharp corners/stress concentration).
Brittleness — Clinical Summary (Margin Design)
Core rule: Brittle materials fracture if they are thin or unsupported → they need bulk and
support at margins.
1) Amalgam (low edge strength)
● Problem: Thin amalgam margins snap.
● Result: Marginal fracture/ditching → leakage + recurrent caries.
● Margin design: 90° butt joint; no bevels.
2) Porcelain / ceramics (low fracture toughness)

-- 23 of 29 --

● Problem: Cracks propagate easily, especially in thin areas.
● Result: Chipping or catastrophic fracture.
● Margin design: Shoulder / heavy chamfer + adequate thickness (avoid feather
edges).
●
3) Unsupported enamel
● Problem: Enamel is brittle without dentin support.
● Result: Margin fractures under chewing.
● Fix: Remove unsupported enamel rods.
Quick comparison
● Amalgam: brittle → butt joint (no bevel).
● Porcelain: brittle → shoulder/heavy chamfer (bulk).
● Gold: ductile → bevel/feather (can thin + burnish).

-- 24 of 29 --

7)Hardness:
Hardness = surface scratch/indentation resistance.
Clinically, it mainly tells you (1) how fast the restoration itself wears and (2) how much it
might wear the opposing surface — but opposing-tooth wear depends MORE on surface
roughness/polish than hardness alone.
What hardness correlates with (clinically useful)
● Higher hardness → better self–wear resistance
(keeps anatomy/occlusion longer; less scratching)
● Higher hardness → harder to finish/adjust/polish
(more bur time, more heat, more difficulty getting a smooth surface)
● Higher hardness + rough surface → more antagonist wear (enamel gets abraded)
What hardness does NOT guarantee
● Hard ≠ automatically more abrasive.
A high-hardness but well-polished surface can be gentle, while a less-hard but
rough surface can still abrade.
● Hardness ≠ strength.
Strength = load before fracture/bending; hardness = surface resistance.

-- 25 of 29 --

“Different materials” — how hardness plays out
clinically
Very hard / hard surfaces
Ceramics (porcelain) and zirconia
● Self-wear: very low (they stay shiny/anatomic)
● Opposing enamel: can be high wear if rough (after adjustment or if glaze is removed)
● Clinical key: polish matters more than glaze for antagonist friendliness; rough
ceramic is the enemy.
Porcelain denture teeth
● Harder → keep cusps (good self-wear resistance)
● Can be more abrasive to opposing natural teeth if occlusion/polish isn’t ideal.
Natural tooth reference
Enamel
● Hard, but can still wear if the opposing surface is rough/harder and unpolished.
Medium hardness (varies)
Composites
● Usually wear more than ceramics (can lose occlusal anatomy over time)
● Often kinder to opposing enamel than rough ceramics because they’re less hard and
can be polished smoothly.
Amalgam
● Good in compression, but surface can wear/ditch over time compared to ceramics
● Generally less abrasive to opposing enamel than rough ceramics (again: surface +
microstructure matter).
Lower hardness
Gold / high noble
● Softer → can wear a bit, but tends to be “kind” to opposing enamel
● Great when you want a restoration that doesn’t act like sandpaper.

-- 26 of 29 --

Acrylic denture teeth (PMMA)
● Low hardness → wears faster (flat cusps over time)
● Usually gentler on opposing teeth than porcelain denture teeth.
Base-metal alloys (Co–Cr, Ni–Cr): hardness correlation +
clinical relevance
Hardness level: generally high (harder than noble gold alloys, often harder than many
restorative metals).
What that means clinically
1. They resist scratching and surface wear (self-wear)
● Co–Cr / Ni–Cr surfaces don’t get scratched easily → durable metal surface.
● Useful where you want the metal surface to stay intact (e.g., metal components
rubbing/contacts).
2. They are harder to adjust, finish, and polish
● Chairside: more difficult to cut/shape; burs wear faster; takes longer to get a smooth
polish.
● Lab: finishing and polishing is more demanding than gold.
3. Opposing tooth wear
● A high-hardness metal can contribute to wear of the opposing surface if left rough
(after adjustment).
● But metals (including base metals) are usually less abrasive than rough ceramics
because polished metal can be very smooth.
● Clinical key: after adjusting Co–Cr/Ni–Cr, polish it properly to reduce antagonist wear.
Quick comparison line (exam-friendly)
● Ceramic hardness + roughness → highest risk of opposing enamel wear.

-- 27 of 29 --

● Base-metal alloys are hard, but when well polished they are usually relatively
“enamel-friendly.”
● Gold is softer and typically the most “kind” to opposing enamel (but may wear
itself more).
The simplest clinical rule
● If it’s hard + rough → it will abrade the opposing tooth.
● If it’s hard + highly polished → much safer.
● If it’s soft → it may wear itself (lose anatomy), but is often kinder to the opposing tooth.
B. The "Confusables" Table
Concept A 	Concept B 	The Difference
Ductility 	Malleability 	Ductility = Pulling into a wire (Tension). Malleability = Hammering into a sheet (Compression).
Most malleable dental material: Gold (especially pure/annealed gold, e.g., gold foil).
Memory line:
● Ductile = wire → Gold is best
● Malleable = sheet/foil → Gold is best
Stress 	Strain 	Stress = The internal force (Pressure). Strain = The physical shape change (Deformation).

-- 28 of 29 --

Hardness 	Abrasion 	Hardness = Resistance to indentation. Abrasion = Resistance to rubbing/wear. A material can
be hard but still wear away (abrade) opposing teeth!
