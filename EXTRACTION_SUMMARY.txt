KEY FINDINGS FROM EXTRACTION
================================================================================

1. IMAGE NAMING vs. APPEARANCE ORDER:
   - Images named image1.png through image25.png
   - BUT appear in NON-SEQUENTIAL order in document
   - Appearance order: 10, 1, 13, 4, 3, 14, 16, 15, 18, 2, 17, 20, 19, 7, 24, 9, 21, 5, 8, 12, 22, 6, 23, 25, 11
   - Suggests Google Docs export numbered differently
   - Recommendation: Rename images to match appearance sequence for clarity

2. IMAGE DISTRIBUTION:
   - First 3 images: General CN overview
   - Images 4-13: Exclusively CN V (trigeminal) - 10 images
   - Images 14-18: Exclusively CN VII (facial) - 5 images
   - Images 19-25: Supporting figures - varied applications

   - Smallest: Image 7 (595 x 317px) - Sensory distribution
   - Most: around 1100 x 600px range
   - Variation suggests mix of formats and sources

   - 60% of document covers CN V and CN VII (high-yield for dentistry)
   - 15% clinical application and integration
   - 25% general CN overview and individual descriptions
   - Heavy emphasis on practical dental applications

5. EXAM STRUCTURE:

  - Original section structure and hierarchy
  - All tables, figures, and organized information
  - Image sequence in appearance order
  - Clinical context and relationships
  - Mnemonics and memory aids
  - Exam-style questions and answers
  - Dental-specific applications
  - Comprehensive image descriptions

Nothing simplified or summarized - FULL ORIGINAL CONTENT preserved.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION FOR NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Rename images from current sequence to appearance order:
   - image10 to image01_brainstem_view
   - image1 to image02_cn_overview
   - [continue following appearance order]

2. Create companion image file with all 25 images
   - Organize by appearance sequence
   - Use standardized naming

3. Consider creating markdown version
   - Cross-links to images
   - Interactive document format
   - Better for online study

4. Generate study guides
   - Flash cards from mnemonics
   - Block technique quick reference
   - Examination checklists
