Before We Start: How to Think About “Properties”
To use dental materials safely and intelligently, we first need:
1. Clear definitions
○ What each property actually means (strength, toughness, rheology,
solubility, etc.).
2. Clinical correlation (the more important part)
○ How that property affects:
■ Operative (restorations, liners, composites)
■ Ortho (wires, adhesives)
■ Prostho (impressions, cements, denture bases, crowns)
This may feel like a lot of theory, but the goal is simple:
Know the few key properties that actually change how you select, handle, and
evaluate materials in the clinic—and the way they are asked in exams.

Properties of Dental Materials: summary
(Physical + Chemical + Mechanical + Rheological + Optical + Manufacturing + Electrical + Biological)

1) Thermal Properties
Dental materials face constant thermal cycling (hot coffee ~60°C → ice cream ~0°C). Their
response controls marginal seal, longevity, and pulpal safety.

A) Dimensional Change & Integrity
1) Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE, α)
● Definition: Fractional change in length per 1°C temperature change.
● Clinical Significance (Percolation): Ideally, restorative CTE should match enamel/dentin.
● Mismatch scenario: Composites often have higher CTE than enamel.
○ Cold drink → composite contracts more than tooth → microscopic marginal gap opens
○ Saliva/bacteria are sucked in → then warming closes gap and traps fluids
● Outcome: Percolation → recurrent caries, marginal staining, post-op sensitivity.

PFM bonding rule (CTE compatibility):
● Metal substructure must have slightly higher CTE than porcelain.
● Cooling after firing → metal contracts slightly more → porcelain placed under compression → fewer craze lines (porcelain strong in compression).

2) Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)
● Definition: Temperature range where a polymer changes from glassy/brittle → rubbery/flexible.
● Clinical relevance: Dental polymers (acrylic, composite resins) must have Tg well above 37°C (mouth temperature).
● If Tg is too low → hot drinks can soften/warp denture base or reduce rigidity.

B) Heat Transfer
3) Thermal Conductivity (k)
● Definition: Rate of heat flow through a material.
● Clinical relevance:
○ Enamel/dentin = poor conductors (natural insulation)
○ Metals (amalgam/gold) = high conductors → thermal shock can reach pulp
○ Deep cavity removes insulation → place base/liner (low conductivity) under metal restorations → reduces pulpal pain.

4) Thermal Diffusivity (αᵗ)
● Definition: Rate at which a temperature change spreads through a material.
○ Key relation: αᵗ = k / (ρ · c) where k=conductivity, ρ=density, c=specific heat
● Clinical relevance: More clinically useful than conductivity alone.
○ Denture base should have low diffusivity → heat reaches mucosa slowly → “warning time” to avoid burns (acrylic helps).

C) State Changes
5) Melting point / Fusion temperature (pure metals)
● Definition: Temperature where a pure solid becomes liquid.
● Example reference: Pure gold = 1064°C.

6) Melting range (alloys): Liquidus & Solidus
● Liquidus: Above this, alloy is 100% liquid (casting: must heat above this).
● Solidus: Below this, alloy is 100% solid (soldering: stay below this so components don’t melt).
● Melting range = Liquidus − Solidus

7) Eutectic temperature
● Definition: Specific alloy composition with lowest melting temperature, often melting sharply like a pure metal.
● Clinical relevance
● During soldering:
○ Solder melts quickly and completely
○ Parent crown/bridge alloy (higher solidus) does NOT melt
● → Accurate joints, minimal distortion, predictable results

2) Chemical Properties
Oral cavity is wet, warm, acidic, and enzymatic → materials must resist degradation and preserve margins.

1) Tarnish vs Corrosion
● Tarnish: Surface discoloration (often sulfides). Mainly esthetic.
● Corrosion: Electrochemical breakdown with ion release → can weaken restoration.

Galvanic shock (chemical/electrochemical aspect):
● Two dissimilar metals + saliva (electrolyte) → battery → shock sensation + accelerated corrosion of less noble metal.

2) Solubility & Disintegration
● Definition: The dissolution and breakdown of materials (mainly cements, restoratives, and sealers) in oral fluids, significantly impacting restoration lifespan.
● Clinical relevance: Zinc phosphate & polycarboxylate cements can dissolve over years → marginal “washout” → plaque retention → secondary caries → crown loosening.
● Resin cements: very low solubility.

3) Surface Energy (Wetting) + Contact Angle
● High surface energy (solid): clean/etched enamel → promotes wetting
● Low surface tension (liquid): primers/adhesives → spread better
● Contact angle:
○ Low angle → good wetting → resin penetrates microporosities
○ High angle → beading → poor wetting → bond failure

3) Mechanical Properties
Determines survival under mastication and parafunction.

A) Stress–Strain Core
1) Elastic Modulus (E, stiffness)
● Definition: Slope of linear stress–strain curve.
● Clinical relevance:
○ High E for rigid substructures (PFM framework)
○ Lower E helpful in cervical/Class V regions → flex with tooth; too stiff → debonding.

2) Proportional limit / Elastic limit
● Definition: Maximum stress without permanent deformation.
● Clinical relevance: Partial denture clasp must flex below this; exceeding it → permanent bend → loss of retention.

B) Strength Parameters
3) Yield strength (0.2% offset)
● Definition: Stress where plastic deformation becomes noticeable.
● Clinical relevance: If framework yields → veneer porcelain can crack immediately.

4) Ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
● Definition: Maximum tensile stress before rupture.
● Clinical relevance: Important for tensile pulls (sticky foods, connectors).

5) Compressive strength
● Definition: Resistance to crushing.
● Clinical relevance: Chewing is mostly compressive → enamel and amalgam do well here.

6) Fracture toughness (KIC)
● Definition: Resistance to crack propagation.
● Clinical relevance:
○ Glassy porcelains: low KIC → scratches can become catastrophic fractures
○ Zirconia: high KIC via transformation toughening (tetragonal→monoclinic expansion creates compressive stress around crack).

C) Surface & Durability
7) Hardness (Knoop/Vickers)
● Definition: Resistance to indentation.
● Clinical relevance: Too hard vs opposing enamel → enamel wear (older porcelains). Modern materials aim to be enamel-compatible.

8) Fatigue strength
● Definition: Failure under cyclic stresses below yield strength.
● Clinical relevance: Implant component fatigue, endodontic file separation, repeated chewing cycles → microcracks → sudden failure.

4) Rheological Properties (Flow)
Most materials start as pastes/fluids → flow behavior controls impression accuracy, seating, handling.

A) Viscosity Dynamics
1) Pseudoplasticity (shear-thinning)
● “Faster you push → thinner it gets”
● Useful: extrudes easily through syringe tip (high shear) but doesn’t slump at rest (low shear).

2) Dilatancy (shear-thickening)
● “Harder you push → thicker it gets”
● Clinical warning: over-mixing some systems → particle crowding → thickening/poor flow.

B) Time-dependent
3) Thixotropy
● Gel becomes liquid under stress and needs time to recover after stress ends.
● Example: fluoride gels flow into spaces when biting, then slowly thicken to prevent gagging.

C) Viscoelasticity
4) Creep (static/dynamic)
● Slow permanent deformation under constant or cyclic load.
● Example: amalgam ditching from marginal creep → breakdown.

5) Stress relaxation
● Stress decreases under constant strain.
● Example: orthodontic elastomeric chains lose force significantly over time.

5) Optical Properties
Esthetics = how light is transmitted, absorbed, scattered, and re-emitted.

1) Translucency vs Opacity
● Translucency gives lifelike depth.
● Opacity is needed to mask discoloration or metal posts.

2) Metamerism
● Color match under one light but mismatch under another.
● Clinical tip: shade-match under multiple light sources (daylight + color-corrected light).

3) Fluorescence
● UV absorbed → visible blue-white emission.
● If crown lacks fluorescence → looks dark/“dead” under UV-rich lighting.

4) Opalescence
● Short wavelengths scatter more → bluish incisal edge, warm transmitted light effect.
● Modern composites use opalescent fillers to mimic incisal halo.

6) Manufacturing / Processing Properties
Castability: affected by density + surface tension.
● Gold casts easily; Titanium needs vacuum/argon (oxygen-reactive + high surface tension).

Polishability: depends on filler size.
● Macrofill: rough → stains/plaque
● Nanofill: high gloss, stain resistance (particles below visible light wavelength)

7) Electrical Properties
The mouth is an electrolyte environment. Metals can conduct current and form galvanic cells.

1) Electrical conductivity / resistivity
● Metals: high conductivity → can transmit stimuli
● Resins/ceramics/dentin: insulators → block current

2) Galvanic current (Galvanic shock)
● Two dissimilar metals + saliva → current flow
● Symptoms: sharp pain/tingling, metallic taste
● Outcome: accelerated corrosion of less noble metal (anode)

3) Electrochemical potential (nobility)
● Noble alloys resist corrosion more.
● Less noble materials corrode faster when paired with noble restorations.

8) Biological / Biocompatibility
Materials must be safe for pulp, mucosa, and body tissues over long-term exposure.

1) Pulpal response / irritation
● Deep cavities increase pulp risk; chemical irritants can diffuse through dentin.
● Examples: acidic primers, monomer release, exothermic reactions → potential sensitivity/inflammation.

2) Cytotoxicity / leachable components
● Unreacted monomers or additives can leach → soft tissue irritation, delayed healing, possible sensitivity.

3) Allergy / hypersensitivity
● Common triggers: nickel alloys, latex, certain resin components.
● Clinical importance: history of dermatitis/asthma/allergy matters for material selection.

4) Biofilm/plaque affinity
● Rough surfaces retain plaque more.
● Poor polish or marginal gaps → increased gingival inflammation and secondary caries risk.
