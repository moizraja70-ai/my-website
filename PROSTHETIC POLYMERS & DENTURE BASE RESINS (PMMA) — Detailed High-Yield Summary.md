## **PROSTHETIC POLYMERS & DENTURE BASE RESINS (PMMA) — Detailed High-Yield Summary**

### **1\) Key Terms (Exam definitions \+ clinical meaning)**

**Inhibitor**

* **Definition:** Added to monomer to prevent unwanted polymerization during storage → increases shelf life.  
* **Example:** **Hydroquinone** in MMA liquid.  
* **Clinical impact:** Prevents monomer bottle from “setting” in storage; **slightly delays curing** → more working time.

**Liner**

* **Definition:** Polymeric material used to replace the **tissue-contacting (intaglio)** surface of an existing denture.  
* **Purpose:** Improve **fit, comfort, tissue adaptation**.

**Soft liner**

* **Definition:** Resilient polymer placed on tissue surface to absorb masticatory energy (**shock absorber**).  
* **Functions:** Comfort, distributes force, can engage undercuts → improves **retention/stability/support**.

**Short-term soft liner (Tissue conditioner)**

* **Definition:** Used briefly (**≤14 days**) to adapt to changing ridge (post-extraction/surgery).  
* **Key composition feature:** Often **chemically activated** \+ **plasticizers**.  
* **Why temporary:** Plasticizers **leach out** → becomes **hard/rough**, loses cushioning.

**Long-term soft liner**

* **Definition:** Resilient liner intended up to \~**1 year**.  
* **Processing:** Usually **heat-processed** → more durable than short-term.  
* **Limitations:** Still degrades → discoloration, odor, Candida, bond failure.

**Relining**

* **Definition:** Replacing only the **tissue surface** of existing denture (teeth \+ most base remain).  
* **Goal:** Restore adaptation after ridge resorption **without remaking** denture.

**Rebasing**

* **Definition:** Replacing the **entire denture base**, keeping the **teeth**.  
* **Indication:** Base is defective/old/warped/stained but teeth acceptable.

### **2\) What is a Complete Denture?**

* A **removable prosthesis** replacing **all teeth** and associated structures in maxilla/mandible.  
* Components: **Artificial teeth \+ denture base** (tissue contact for support).

---

### **3\) Why PMMA is the Standard Denture Base Resin**

**Main reasons PMMA replaced older materials:**

* **Esthetics:** Can be tinted to simulate gingiva.  
* **Clinical acceptability:** Adequate strength, comfort, easy repairs.  
* **Processing:** Powder–liquid system (dough) → easy flasking and curing.  
* **Biocompatibility:** Generally good; key concern \= **residual monomer**.

---

### **4\) Ideal Requirements of Denture Base Material (High-yield headings)**

**A) Biologic**

* Non-toxic, non-irritant, non-allergenic; compatible with tissues.

**B) Patient acceptability**

* Odorless/tasteless; esthetic, color stable; comfortable, lightweight.

**C) Physical/clinical performance**

* Dimensional stability, adequate strength, low water sorption/solubility, good polish, easy processing.

---

### **5\) Classification of Denture Base Resins**

* **Heat-cured PMMA (most common)**  
* **Self-cured / chemically activated PMMA**  
* **Light-activated resins**  
* **Castable resins**  
* **Injection molded polymers** (nylon/polycarbonate; e.g., Ivocap systems)

---

### **6\) Composition (Powder vs Liquid)**

#### **A) Heat-cure PMMA system**

**Powder (polymer)**

* **PMMA beads** (prepolymerized “pre-shrunk” polymer)  
* **Benzoyl peroxide (BPO)** \= initiator  
* Pigments/opacifiers (gingival shade)

**Liquid (monomer)**

* **Methyl methacrylate (MMA)**  
* **Hydroquinone** \= inhibitor  
* **Cross-linker:** glycol dimethacrylate (\~1–2%)

**Cross-linking concept**

* MMA (one double bond) → linear chains  
* Dimethacrylate (two double bonds) → links chains → net-like structure  
* Effects: ↑ resistance to deformation, ↑ craze/solvent resistance (especially alcohol)

#### **B) Self-cure (chemically activated) PMMA**

**Powder**

* PMMA/copolymer \+ **BPO** initiator \+ pigments/opacifiers ± plasticizers/fillers

**Liquid**

* MMA monomer  
* **Tertiary amine activator** (e.g., dimethyl-p-toluidine) → activates BPO at room temp  
* Cross-linker (1–2%), hydroquinone inhibitor (\~0.006%)

---

### **7\) Separating Medium (Why critical)**

**Purpose**

* Stops water from stone diffusing into resin (affects polymerization/optics).  
* Prevents resin soaking into stone → prevents rough, stuck surface.

**Example**

* Sodium alginate solution forming **calcium alginate film**.

**Precautions**

* Wax/oil contamination ruins film.  
* Mold should be warm, not steaming hot.  
* Avoid coating teeth → reduces tooth–base bond.

---

### **8\) Polymer : Monomer Ratio (Very testable)**

* Pure MMA conversion shrinks a lot (\~**21% volumetric**).  
* Prepolymerized PMMA beads reduce shrinkage.  
* **Accepted ratio:** **3 : 1 (polymer : monomer by volume)**  
  * Shrinkage reduced to \~**6% volumetric**, \~**0.5% linear** (as noted).

**Too much monomer**

* ↑ shrinkage, ↑ time to dough, ↑ porosity risk

**Too little monomer**

* Not all beads wetted → granular/weak acrylic, poor fusion, difficult handling

**One-line exam phrasing**

* “Prepolymerized PMMA beads reduce shrinkage because they reduce the volume of monomer undergoing polymerization shrinkage.”

---

### **9\) Polymer–Monomer Interaction Stages (5 stages)**

**Sandy → Stringy → Dough → Rubbery → Stiff**

1. **Sandy:** beads just wetted, no cohesion  
2. **Stringy:** monomer dissolves bead surfaces → sticky strands  
3. **Dough (IDEAL for packing):** pliable, non-tacky, moldable  
4. **Rubbery:** elastic rebound → inaccurate fit if packed  
5. **Stiff:** rigid/dry; cannot mold

**Temperature effect**

* Warm room → stages pass faster  
* Refrigeration extends working time but avoid condensation contamination.

---

### **10\) Packing \+ Bench Curing (Exam-important)**

**Packing**

* Adapt resin into mold under pressure.

**Overpacking**

* Flask won’t close → increased base thickness → alters **VDO**, tooth movement possible.

**Underpacking**

* Not enough material → voids/porosity as polymerization shrinkage occurs.

**Bench curing (30–60 min at room temp after closure)**

* Equalizes pressure, improves monomer diffusion, improves tooth-base bond (especially with resin teeth).

---

### **11\) Polymerization Chemistry \+ Porosity Mechanism**

**Heat cure**

* Heat (\~\>60°C) decomposes **BPO** → free radicals → chain polymerization  
* **Initiator:** BPO  
* **Activator:** Heat

**Porosity danger**

* Reaction is exothermic \+ stone/resin are poor conductors → heat builds in thick areas.  
* If internal temperature exceeds **MMA boiling point (100.8°C)** → monomer boils → bubbles trapped → **gaseous porosity**.

**Why thick areas porose (palate/lingual flange)**

* Low surface area:volume → heat trapped → monomer vapor bubbles → pores.

---

### **12\) Curing Cycles (Memorizable)**

Common successful cycles:

* **74°C for 8 hours** (no terminal boil)  
* **74°C for 8 hours \+ 100°C for 1 hour**  
* **74°C \~2 hours \+ 100°C for 1 hour**

**Goal balance**

* Avoid overheating (porosity) while minimizing residual monomer (biocompatibility).

---

### **13\) Types of Denture Base Resins (Pros/cons in one place)**

**Heat-cure PMMA**

* Pros: better conversion, lower residual monomer, better color stability, less porosity  
* Cons: needs heat \+ lab precision

**Self-cure PMMA**

* Pros: convenient for repair/reline/trays; no high external heat  
* Cons: more residual monomer (**\~3–5%** vs heat cure **\~0.2–0.5%**) → irritation \+ lower strength, more porosity/distortion

**Pour/Fluid resin**

* Pros: improved adaptation, easier deflasking  
* Cons: tooth shifting, air entrapment porosity, poor bonding, technique sensitive

**Light-activated**

* UDMA matrix \+ microfine silica; camphorquinone initiator; supplied as sheets/ropes

**Injection-molded (e.g., nylon/polycarbonate; Ivocap systems)**

* Pros: constant pressure compensates shrinkage; accuracy, homogeneous base, low free monomer, good impact strength  
* Cons: expensive equipment, special flasks, less craze resistance

---

### **14\) Self-cure vs Heat-cure (Core differences)**

**Self-cure**

* ↑ porosity, ↓ molecular weight, ↑ residual monomer, ↑ creep/distortion, poorer color stability

**Heat-cure**

* ↓ porosity, ↑ molecular weight, ↓ residual monomer, better recovery, better color stability

---

### **15\) Important Numbers (Quick exam facts)**

* **MMA boiling point:** **100.8°C** (very important)  
* PMMA: Knoop hardness \~18–20; tensile strength \~60 MPa; modulus \~2.4 GPa; softens \~125°C

---

### **16\) Defects (Causes \+ Prevention) — Long question ready**

#### **A) Porosity (VVIMP)**

**Causes**

1. **Monomer boiling** in thick areas (temp \>100.8°C)  
2. **Poor mixing** → uneven monomer distribution  
3. **Insufficient pressure / underpacking**  
4. **Pour resin air entrapment**

**Prevention**

* Correct ratio (3:1), homogeneous mixing  
* Pack at dough stage  
* Bench curing (pressure equalization \+ monomer dispersion)  
* Controlled curing cycle  
* Maintain pressure (especially self-cure)

#### **B) Crazing (microcracks)**

**Main causes**

* **Thermal shock** (rapid cooling/quenching)  
* **Solvents** (alcohol-containing mouthwash/cleaners)  
* **Dehydration cycles** (wet–dry fatigue)

**Prevention**

* Bench cool slowly  
* No alcohol soaking  
* Store in water when out of mouth

#### **C) Warpage**

**Causes**

* Premature deflasking while hot  
* Hot water/boiling exposure by patient  
* Friction heat during aggressive polishing  
* During repair: heat \+ shrinkage pull

**Prevention**

* Let flask fully cool before opening  
* Patient: no hot water  
* Use correct polishing technique  
* Repairs: prefer **cold-cure PMMA** \+ **pressure pot** (control exotherm), match CTE

---

### **17\) Water Sorption & Solubility (Clinical relevance)**

**Water sorption**

* Slight expansion can partly compensate shrinkage  
* Water plasticizes → slightly reduces strength/stiffness  
* Small dimensional changes over time

**Solubility**

* PMMA low solubility in oral fluids  
* Organic solvents (alcohol) are the major clinical problem → crazing risk

---

### **18\) Biocompatibility & Allergy (Exam-safe lines)**

* Main issue \= **residual monomer**  
* Self-cure has higher free monomer (3–5%) than heat-cure (0.2–0.5%)  
* More residual monomer → tissue irritation \+ reduced strength (plasticizer effect)  
* Lab safety: monomer contact → dermatitis risk; use gloves/ventilation.

---

### **19\) Relining vs Rebasing (Must-know decision logic)**

**Reline**

* Replace only intaglio surface  
* Use when: occlusion/VDO OK, teeth OK, base acceptable, but fit lost due to resorption

**Rebase**

* Replace entire pink base; teeth retained  
* Use when: base is warped/stained/porous/cracked but teeth acceptable

**If teeth worn \+ VDO lost:** neither → **new denture**

---

### **20\) Soft liners (Short vs Long)**

**Short-term tissue conditioners (≤14 days)**

* Very soft; plasticizer leaching → hard/rough quickly  
* Best: post-surgery, healing ridges, tissue recovery

**Long-term liners (\~months to 1 year)**

* More durable but fail by: delamination, porosity/debris trapping, Candida, odor, discoloration

---

### **21\) Denture Teeth: Resin vs Porcelain (MCQ favorite)**

**Resin teeth (PMMA)**

* Pros: less abrasive, easier adjustment, better impact resistance, can chemically bond to base  
* Cons: wear faster

**Porcelain teeth**

* Pros: excellent wear resistance  
* Cons: abrasive to opposing enamel, no chemical bond (mechanical retention via diatorics/pins), possible dark line at junction

## **Denture Cleansers & Adhesives — Summary**

### **A) Denture Cleansers**

**Why important**

* Dentures collect plaque, stains, calculus, Candida → stomatitis, odor, staining, reduced retention.

**Ideal cleanser goals**

* Removes biofilm/stains safely, antibacterial/antifungal, non-toxic, compatible with PMMA/metal/liners, doesn’t cause roughness/warpage/corrosion.

**Methods**

1. **Mechanical:** brushing (daily core), ultrasonic (adjunct)  
2. **Chemical soaking:** alkaline peroxide tablets, hypochlorite, acids, disinfectants, enzymatic  
3. Selected: microwave disinfection (protocol dependent)

**Key products**

* **Alkaline peroxide tablets:** effervescence loosens debris; mild bleaching; best after brushing  
* **Hypochlorite (bleach):** strong antifungal/antibacterial \+ stain removal BUT corrodes metal, can bleach acrylic  
* **Acid cleansers:** remove calculus; can corrode metal  
* **Chlorhexidine:** useful in Candida/stomatitis but stains with long use  
* **Enzymatic:** breaks mucin/organic film (protease/amylase)

**Big “Don’ts”**

* No abrasive toothpaste (scratches acrylic)  
* No hot/boiling water (warpage)  
* Be careful with bleach on partial dentures (metal corrosion)  
* Soft liners: avoid harsh cleansers (leaching/roughness/Candida)

**Daily routine**

* Brush denture (especially tissue surface) \+ rinse  
* Night soak (appropriate cleanser/water) \+ store immersed

---

### **B) Denture Adhesives**

**Definition**

* Non-toxic soluble material applied to intaglio surface to improve retention/stability by improving the saliva film interface.

**How they work**

* Hydrate → swell → fill gaps → ↑ viscosity/adhesion/cohesion → better seal & comfort.

**Indications**

* Immediate dentures, xerostomia, mild resorption/borderline retention, neuromuscular issues, short-term confidence.

**Contraindications**

* Grossly ill-fitting denture, fractures/missing flanges, poor hygiene, allergy, pathology needing treatment.  
* Exam line: **“Adhesives are adjuncts, not substitutes for correct dentures.”**

**Types**

* Cream/paste (strong hold), powder (thin film), strips (clean but bulky feeling)

**Red flags → needs correction, not more adhesive**

* Increasing adhesive use, rocking, recurrent sore spots, persistent food packing → likely needs adjustment/reline/rebase/new denture.

## **Ultra-High-Yield “Exam Answer Lines”**

* Hydroquinone is an **inhibitor** in MMA preventing storage polymerization.  
* BPO is the **initiator**; **heat** is the activator in heat-cure PMMA.  
* Stages: **sandy → stringy → dough → rubbery → stiff**; pack at **dough** stage.  
* Bench curing (30–60 min) improves monomer diffusion, pressure equalization, and tooth–base bond.  
* Avoid exceeding **100.8°C** (MMA BP) to prevent **gaseous porosity**.  
* Self-cure has higher residual monomer than heat-cure → more irritation \+ lower strength.
