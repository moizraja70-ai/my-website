Main energy sources:\n  - 1. **Heat** → thermal activation\n  - 2. **Chemical activator** (electron donor) like tertiary amine → lowers energy needed so polymerization can occur at room temperature\n  - 3. **Visible light** → photoinitiation (with a photosensitizer like **camphorquinone, CQ**)\n\n![Activator Types](assets/composite_img_2_1.png)\n\n### Initiator\n\n- ● A chemical that forms **free radicals** to start polymerization and becomes part of the final polymer (so it is not a catalyst).\n- ● **Free radical** = species with an unpaired electron that initiates chain-growth polymerization by attacking **C=C** bonds.\n\n### Inhibitor\n\n- ● Added to reduce spontaneous polymerization → **increases working time + shelf life**, typically by scavenging free radicals (e.g., **BHT**).\n\n![Initiator and Inhibitor](assets/composite_img_3_1.png)\n\nThe above are general terms are used for other material as well\n\n<span style="color: red">**General terms for all can skip**</span>\n\n### What is the resin (matrix) in composite?\n\n- ● The **resin matrix** is the plastic part of the composite (the "cement" that later hardens). It is mainly a mix of **methacrylate monomers** (like Bis-GMA, UDMA, TEGDMA) plus small additives (initiator, inhibitor, pigments).\n\n---\n\n### 2) What is a monomer?\n\n- ● A **monomer** is a **small single molecule** that can join with many others to form a polymer. In dental composites, monomers usually have a reactive group called:\n  - ▫️ **Methacrylate group** with a **C=C double bond**\n- ● That **C=C** is the "handle" that opens during curing so monomers can join.\n\nExample idea:\n- ● Monomer = one "link" of a chain\n\n---\n\n### 3) What is a polymer?\n\n- ● A **polymer** is a **very large molecule** made when many monomers join together.\n  - ▫️ If it\'s mostly one long line → **linear polymer**\n  - ▫️ If many chains join together → **cross-linked polymer network** (this is what composite becomes)\n\nExample idea:\n- ● Polymer = a long chain / network made of many links\n\n---\n\n### 4) What groups do composite monomers have?\n\n- ● Most composite monomers are **dimethacrylates** (very important word):\n  - ▫️ **Dimethacrylate = 2 methacrylate groups (2 C=C bonds) on the same molecule**\n\nExamples:\n- ● **Bis-GMA** (big, thick, strong backbone)\n- ● **UDMA** (strong, slightly less viscous)\n- ● **TEGDMA** (small "thinner" monomer)\n\n✅ **Why "two" groups matter**:\n- ● If a monomer has two **C=C** bonds, it can join two chains by forming –C–C– it has 2 open arms which can bind to similar monomers → creates cross-linking.\n\n---\n\n### 5) What are "pendant groups"?\n\n- ● A **pendant group** is a side group that hangs off the main polymer chain **without being part of the backbone**. In composites, this usually means:\n  - ▫️ Some methacrylate **C=C bonds do NOT react**\n  - ▫️ They remain as **unreacted side double bonds** attached to the polymer network\n- ● So you get:\n  - ▫️ A polymer backbone (main chain)\n  - ▫️ Plus **pendant unreacted C=C groups** sticking out\n\n✅ **Why pendant groups matter**:\n- ● They explain why **degree of conversion is not 100%**\n\n- ● **Matrix**: The continuous resin phase (plastic monomer blend) that cures into a solid and binds fillers together.\n- ● **Filler**: Inorganic/glass/organic resin particles dispersed in matrix to increase strength.\n- ● **Coupling agent**: A chemical that bonds filler to resin matrix (most commonly organosilanes like γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). Essential for strength/toughness and resistance to degradation.\n- ● **Depth of cure**: How deep a light-cured resin can cure under specific curing conditions (practical limit usually **~2–3 mm** per increment).\n\n![Depth of Cure Diagram](assets/composite_depth_of_cure_new.png)\n\n---\n\n## Dental Composite Polymerization: Mechanism & Clinical Reality\n<span style="color: red">can skip</span> just but this is the same process that will be seen in 2 more topics so better to once or **dental composites, elastomers, and denture base resins**.\n\n### 1) Initiation (The Curing Light)\n\n- ● **Generic**: Initiator + Energy → Free Radical\n- ● **Dental Context**:\n  - ▫️ **The Energy Source**: The dentist uses a Blue Curing Light (wavelength ~468 nm).\n  - ▫️ **The Initiator**: The composite contains **Camphorquinone** (the photoinitiator).\n  - ▫️ **The Process**: When the blue light hits the Camphorquinone, it gets excited and reacts with an **Amine** (accelerator) in the paste.\n  - ▫️ **The Result**: This reaction releases **Free Radicals**.\n  - ▫️ ✅ **Key Idea**: You press the button on the curing light → Free radicals are born.\n\n### 2) Propagation (The Hardening)\n\n![Polymerization Process](assets/composite_img_8_1.png)\n\n- ● **Generic**: Active center + monomer → Polymer Chain\n- ● **Dental Context**:\n  - ▫️ **The Monomers**: The soft paste is full of resin monomers like **bis-GMA** or **TEGDMA**. These molecules have Carbon-Carbon double bonds (**C=C**).\n  - ▫️ **The Reaction**: The free radicals attack the **C=C** double bonds, breaking them open.\n\n### 3) Termination (The Stop)\n\n![Free Radicals Process](assets/composite_img_9_1.png)\n\n- ● **Generic**: Active center destroyed → Reaction stops\n- ● **Dental Context**:\n  - ▫️ **Chain Collision**: Two growing polymer chains crash into each other, canceling out their free radicals. The network is "locked."\n  - ▫️ **Oxygen Inhibition (Crucial Clinical Detail)**: Oxygen is a "radical scavenger." On the very top surface of the filling (where air touches it), oxygen kills the radicals *before* they can cure.\n  - ▫️ **The Result**: This leaves a sticky, uncured layer on top called the **Oxygen Inhibition Layer**.\n  - ▫️ ✅ **Key Idea**: The sticky layer is actually good—it allows the *next* layer of composite you add to stick to the previous one chemically.\n\nWe use an activator (energy source) to activate an initiator, which starts polymerization by producing a highly reactive free radical. The free radical attacks the C=C double bond of a monomer, opens it, and creates a reactive end ("free hand"). That reactive end keeps adding more monomers, so the chain grows and forms a cross-linked network. The reaction stops when two growing polymer chains with free radicals combine with each other, or when radicals are inhibited (especially by oxygen at the surface, forming an oxygen-inhibited layer).\n\n### Summary Table for Review\n\n| Step | In General Chemistry | In Dental Composite |\n|:---|:---|:---|\n| Start | Energy + Initiator | Blue Light + Camphorquinone |\n| Growth | Monomer + Radical | bis-GMA + Free Radical (Paste turns hard) |\n| Stop | Radical Death / Impurities | Oxygen Inhibition Layer (Sticky top surface) |\n\n\n\n**Gel point / Gelation:** Point where crosslinks become sufficient → resin becomes rigid (glassy), internal flow stops.\n● Before gel point: stress can relax by polymer chain flow\n● After gel point: stress cannot relax → stress concentrates at bonded interfaces\n\n**Oxygen-inhibited layer:** Thin surface layer of cured composite with unreacted methacrylate groups due to oxygen inhibiting free-radical polymerization ("air-inhibited layer"). Helpful for bonding additional increments.\n\n**Degree of Conversion (DC):** % of C=C double bonds converted to C–C single bonds during cure.\n● Higher DC → generally better strength, wear resistance, durability\n● Typical DC for bis-GMA composites: around 50–70% (not "all monomer left" — many unreacted double bonds are pendant groups).\n\n**Polymerisation shrinkage (we don\'t want this):** In dental composites, polymerization shrinkage typically ranges from 2% to 5% by volume.\n- ● Composite continues to shrink even after curing because polymerization can keep going slowly. Shrinkage happens because when monomers join and cross-link, the molecules pack closer together, reducing the overall volume.\n\n![Composite Shrinkage](assets/composite_img_11_1.png)\n\n- ● **C-factor (Configuration factor)**: Bonded surface area / unbonded free surface area\n- ● Higher C-factor → higher shrinkage stress at margins → gap formation, marginal leakage, staining, secondary caries risk\n- ● The more bonded surfaces a composite restoration has, the more the material is locked in. So when the composite polymerization-shrinks, it can\'t flow freely and instead pulls away from the tooth walls, creating shrinkage stress. This may open marginal gaps, leading to microleakage, post-operative sensitivity, marginal staining, and eventually secondary caries.\n\n![C-Factor Dangers](assets/composite_img_12_1.png)\n\n![Shrinkage Stress](assets/composite_img_13_1.png)\n\n## 3. The C-Factor (Configuration Factor)\n\n- ● The C-Factor is a formula used to predict the level of polymerization stress a filling will exert on the tooth walls.\n\n### The Formula\n\n- ● **C-Factor = (Number of Bonded Surfaces) / (Number of Unbonded Surfaces)**\n\n### Why it Matters: The "Stress Relief" Concept\n\n- ● **Bonded surfaces**: These are "locked." The composite is glued to the tooth and cannot move.\n- ● **Unbonded surfaces**: These are "free." When the material shrinks, it can "flow" from these free surfaces toward the center to relieve tension.\n- ✅ **The Rule**: The higher the C-Factor, the higher the stress on the tooth.\n\n### Clinical Examples Table\n\n| Cavity Class | Bonded Walls | Unbonded Walls | Calculation | C-Factor | Risk Level |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n| Class I (Occlusal) | 5 (Floor + 4 Walls) | 1 (Top surface) | 5/1 | 5 | 🚨 Highest Risk |\n| Class II (MO/OD) | 4 | 2 | 4/2 | 2 | Moderate |\n| Class IV (Front tooth) | 2 | 4 | 2/4 | 0.5 | ✅ Low Risk |\n\n- ● Note: A Class I cavity is a "recipe for disaster" because 5 walls are pulling inward against only 1 free surface. This often causes **Post-Operative Sensitivity** or **Cracked Cusp Syndrome**.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Dental Uses / Applications\n\nResin composites are used for:\n- ● Direct restorations (Class I–V depending on material)\n- ● Bonding agents/adhesives (with etch systems)\n- ● Pit & fissure sealants\n- ● Endodontic sealants\n- ● Veneer bonding\n- ● Cementation/luting of indirect restorations (resin cements)\n- ● Core build-ups/foundations (especially dual/self-cure)\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Three Essential Components\n\n- ● To understand a dental composite, think of it as a **three-part system**. If any one of these is missing, the material fails.\n\n### A. The Resin Matrix (The "Glue")\n\n- ● **What it is**: A blend of fluid plastic monomers (like **bis-GMA** or **UDMA**).\n- ● **Function**: It creates the continuous phase that binds everything together. It gives the composite its ability to be molded and shaped before curing.\n- ● **Weakness**: On its own, the resin is relatively weak, flexible, prone to wear, and shrinks significantly when it hardens (polymerizes).\n\n- ✅ **One line summary**: **Bis-GMA** and **UDMA** form the continuous resin matrix that acts as the "glue" to hold the filler particles together.\n\n| Monomer Type | Examples | Key Characteristics | Clinical Function / Analogy |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n| Principal | Bis-GMA, UDMA | High Molecular Weight; Aromatic (Stiff); Very Viscous | Analogy: "Cold Honey". Provides strength, stiffness, and durability to the filling. |\n| Diluent | TEGDMA, EGDMA | Low Molecular Weight; Aliphatic (Flexible); Fluid | Analogy: "Milk / Water". Reduces viscosity to make the paste workable, but causes more shrinkage. |\n\n![Resin Matrix Components](assets/composite_img_16_1.png)\n\n---\n\n### B. The Fillers (The "STONE")\n\n- ● **What they are**: Particles of silica, quartz, barium glass, or zirconia.\n- ● **Function**: They reinforce the matrix.\n  - ▫️ **Strength**: They increase stiffness and wear resistance.\n  - ▫️ **Stability**: They reduce polymerization shrinkage (because glass doesn\'t shrink) and thermal expansion.\n  - ▫️ **Appearance**: They provide translucency and radiopacity (visibility on x-rays)\n\n### Why fillers matter (functions)\n\n- ● Fillers provide:\n  - 1. **Reinforcement**: ↑ compressive/tensile strength, ↑ modulus, ↑ toughness\n  - 2. **Reduce polymerization shrinkage**: less resin volume to shrink\n  - 3. **Reduce thermal expansion**: closer to tooth structure → less marginal stress during temperature changes\n  - 4. **Control viscosity/handling**: more filler → thicker paste\n  - 5. **Reduce water sorption**: less resin → less softening/staining\n  - 6. **Radiopacity**: heavy metal fillers (Ba, Sr, Zn, YbF₃) absorb x-rays → detect caries/gaps\n\n- ● Fillers are important because we mainly change a composite\'s properties by increasing or decreasing the filler. More filler usually makes the composite stronger, but the surface can become rougher (like having more "hard particles" in it). Less filler usually makes the composite weaker, but it becomes easier to polish and gives a better finish.\n- ● ✅ **Hybrid composites** are considered the most balanced option, because they combine the good qualities of both worlds.\n\n| Feature | High Filler / Large Particles (The "Rocks") | Low Filler / Small Particles (The "Sand") |\n|:---|:---|:---|\n| Strength | High (Stronger, fracture resistant) | Lower (More prone to chipping/breaking) |\n| Polishability | Poor (Surface feels rough; "plucking" occurs) | Excellent (Retains high gloss) |\n| Wear | High Wear (Rough particles grind opposing teeth) | Low Wear (Smooth surface is gentle) |\n| Example | Macrofilled (Old school) | Microfilled (Great for front teeth veneers) |\n\n![Filler Comparison](assets/composite_img_17_1.png)\n\n---\n\n- ● **Esthetic requirement: refractive index matching**\n  - ▫️ Filler refractive index should match cured resin → good translucency\n  - ▫️ Particle size affects light scattering (big particles increase opacity and roughness)\n\n- ● **Filler loading & packing**\n  - ▫️ Using multiple particle sizes allows tighter packing → higher filler fraction → better properties and reduced shrinkage.\n\n- ● **Coupling agent (Silane)**\n  - ▫️ Forms chemical bridge between filler and resin network\n  - ▫️ Improves strength, wear resistance, and reduces water penetration at interface\n\n- ● ✅ **Without coupling**: fillers act like voids → crack bypasses filler, weak composite.\n\n### Summary\n\n| Component | In Concrete | In Dental Composite | Role |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n| Matrix | Cement paste | Resin (bis-GMA) | Holds everything together; cures to solid. |\n| Coupling | Surface friction | Silane Agent | Bonds the filler to the matrix so they act as one. |\n| Filler | Rocks/Gravel | Glass/Silica particles | Provides bulk, strength, and stops shrinkage. |\n\n![Silane Coupling](assets/composite_img_19_1.png)\n\n---\n\n## 5) Classification — Types of Composites (Crucial Topic)\n\n![Classification Chart](/composite-classification.png)\n\n### A) Classification by filler particle size / distribution\n\n\n\n**1) Traditional (Macrofilled / Conventional)**\n- ● Larger fillers (older category)\n- ● Strong but rough surface over time (matrix wears away → filler protrudes)\n\n**2) Small/Fine particle composites**\n- ● Mean diameters roughly 0.1–10 µm\n- ● Good strength; better polish than macrofilled; cannot reach ultra-high gloss like microfills\n\n**3) Hybrid composites (Most "general purpose")**\n- ● **Hybrid** = mixture of at least two size ranges (often fine glass + micro/nanofiller)\n- ● **Goal**: balance strength + wear resistance + polishability\n- ● Widely used in anterior and many posterior indications (depending on brand)\n\n**4) Microfilled composites**\n- ● **Primary filler** ~ 40 nm colloidal silica\n- ● Extremely high polish and smoothness\n- ● **Problem**: very small particles have huge surface area → increase viscosity → limits filler loading\n- ● **Clinical**: best for low-stress areas, Class III/V, excellent esthetics\n\nTwo styles often described:\n- ● **Homogeneous microfill**: mostly microfiller → very polishable, lower strength\n- ● **Heterogeneous microfill**: contains prepolymerized resin filler particles + microfiller → better handling and loading but weaker interfaces → chipping/wear\n\n---\n\n**5) Nanofilled composites**\n- ● **Primary particles** in nano range (<100 nm), often with "nanoclusters"\n- ● **Aim**: microfill-like polish + higher filler loading (strength)\n- ● In practice, many are actually **nanohybrids** because they include clusters/other particle sizes.\n\n**6) Nanohybrid composites** (Very common modern "universal")\n- ● Mix of nano particles + fine glass fillers\n- ● **Great balance**: strength + good polish + posterior usability\n\n- ● ✅ **High yielding info**: The two main composite types we commonly use are hybrid and nanocomposite.\n  - ▫️ **Hybrid composite** is preferred when we need extra strength (e.g., stress-bearing areas like posterior restorations).\n  - ▫️ Nano/nanohybrid composite is preferred when we need maximum esthetics and polishability (e.g., highly visible anterior restorations).\n\nBUT why are hybrids preferred anyways explained below:\n● Hybrids mix large particles to give the heavy-duty strength missing in microfills, while filling the gaps with tiny particles to give the smooth polish missing in conventional composites. The Result: This "rocks and sand" structure creates a perfect universal material that is strong enough for chewing forces on back teeth yet smooth enough for beautiful smiles on front teeth.\n\n![Hybrid Composites Goldilocks Solution](assets/composite_hybrid_goldilocks.jpg)\n\n### B) Classification by manipulation/handling\n\n**1) Flowable composites**\n- ● Lower filler and/or altered particle distribution → flows\n- ● **Uses**:\n  ○ liners/bases\n  ○ small defects\n  ○ areas needing adaptation\n- ● **Weakness**: lower filler → lower wear resistance and strength\n\n**2) Packable / condensable composites**\n- ● Designed to feel more like amalgam (stiffer handling)\n- ● Achieved by fiber/irregular fillers that interlock\n- ● Intended for posterior placement ease; real-world advantage over good hybrids is limited\n\n---\n\n### C) Classification by curing mode (Very high yield)\n\n| Feature | Chemically Activated (Self-Cure) | Light-Cured (Photo-Cure) | Dual-Cure System |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n| Format | Two Pastes (Base + Catalyst) | Single Paste | Two Pastes (usually) |\n| Activation Mechanism | Chemical Reaction: Benzoyl Peroxide (Initiator) + Tertiary Amine (Activator) | Light Energy: Camphorquinone (CQ) + Amine + Blue Light (~468 nm) | Combination: Chemical cure (slow) + Light cure (fast command set) |\n| Porosity | High (Mixing introduces air bubbles) | Low (No mixing required) | Moderate (Requires mixing) |\n| Working Time | Limited (Starts immediately upon mixing) | "Command Set" (Controlled by operator) | Flexible (Command set + chemical backup) |\n| Esthetics / Color | Poor Stability (Amine oxidation causes yellowing over time) | Excellent Stability (No aromatic amine accelerators) | Compromised (Contains amines, less stable than light-cure) |\n| Stress Buildup | Lower (Slower cure allows stress relaxation) | Higher (Rapid crosslinking locks in stress) | Moderate |\n| Cure Depth | Unlimited (Cures throughout bulk chemically) | Limited (Requires 2mm increments) | Reliable Bulk Cure (Chemical backup for deep areas) |\n| Primary Use | Core build-ups, areas hard to reach with light | Direct restorations (fillings), veneers | Cementing crowns/inlays, deep core build-ups |\n\n---\n\n## 6) Photocuring Lamps & Wavelength Matching\n\n- ● Photoinitiation depends on wavelength overlap with photoinitiator (CQ absorbs ~400–500 nm).\n- ● **Main curing light types**:\n  - 1. **LED**\n    ○ Emits blue range (often 440–480 nm), no filters required\n    ○ Low heat, low power consumption, often battery\n  - 2. **QTH (Quartz-Tungsten-Halogen)**\n    ○ Broad spectrum → needs filters (blue region)\n    ○ Output decreases with age → needs radiometer checks\n  - 3. **PAC (Plasma Arc Curing)**\n    ○ High-intensity filtered output\n  - 4. **Argon laser**\n    ○ Very high intensity, narrow wavelength\n\n### Energy requirement concept (high yield)\n\n- ● Need sufficient **radiant energy** (irradiance × time).\n\n### Critical technique rules\n\n- ● Light intensity decreases rapidly with distance (clinically huge).\n- ● Keep tip as close as possible and perpendicular (90°).\n- ● Clean light guide (resin on tip reduces output).\n- ● Check curing light output periodically.\n\n### Depth of cure limitation\n\n- ● Even with high intensity, light is absorbed/scattered within composite.\n- ● Practical depth remains **~ 2–3 mm** per increment unless curing time is extended significantly.\n\n![Depth of Cure Diagram](assets/composite_depth_of_cure_new.png)\n\n---\n\n## 7) Polymerization Shrinkage & Stress (Most Tested Concept)\n\n### Why shrinkage happens\n\n- ● Monomers pack closer when polymerized → volume reduces. Shrinkage creates stress especially after gel point.\n\n### What increases shrinkage stress\n\n- ● Higher **C-factor** (more bonded surfaces, less free surface)\n- ● Larger bulk volume cured at once\n- ● Faster curing rate (light-cure, high intensity)\n- ● Higher proportion of low-MW diluent monomers (like **TEGDMA**)\n- ● Inadequate incremental technique\n\n### Clinical consequences\n\n- ● Marginal gaps → leakage → sensitivity, staining, secondary caries\n- ● Marginal breakdown\n- ● Post-op sensitivity\n- ● Reduced restoration longevity\n\n### How to reduce shrinkage stress (clinical techniques)\n\n- ● **Incremental layering**: Place composite in diagonal wedges ≤ 2 mm thick. This lowers the effective C-factor and creates more free surfaces.\n- ● **Stress-absorbing liners**: Use a thin base of flowable composite or glass ionomer. Their greater flexibility (lower modulus) acts like a cushion.\n- ● **Soft-start curing**: Use a ramped light curing method. This keeps the material in the pre-gel phase longer, allowing flow.\n- ● **Material choice**: Choose composites with a high filler-to-resin ratio and favor larger monomers (**Bis-GMA/UDMA**).\n- ● **Cavity preparation**: Round internal line angles to avoid sharp corners (stress concentration points).\n- \n![Strategies to Reduce Shrinkage & Stress](/composite-shrinkage-strategies.png)\n\n---\n\n## 8) Properties of Resin-Based Composites (What controls what)\n\n### Strength & modulus\n- ● Increase with filler loading and good coupling\n- ● Higher filler fraction → higher stiffness (modulus), hardness, wear resistance\n- ● ▫️ *Trade-off*: more filler can increase brittleness and reduce handling ease.\n\n### Water sorption\n- ● Mainly from resin matrix\n- ● Higher filler loading → less water uptake → better stain resistance and wear\n\n### Thermal expansion\n- ● Polymers expand more than tooth; fillers reduce expansion closer to tooth structure → less marginal stress.\n\n### Radiopacity\n- ● Achieved by heavy metal glass fillers (**Ba, Sr, Zn**) or YbF₃.\n- ● Ideally radiopacity should allow diagnosis without masking secondary caries.\n\n### Wear\n- ● Two main wear modes:\n  ○ **Two-body wear**: direct contact (tooth/restoration)\n  ○ **Three-body wear**: food bolus abrasion\n- ● Wear resistance improves with small well-bonded fillers and high filler loading.\n\n## 9) Biocompatibility & BPA / Estrogenicity (Short note)\n\n● Risk mainly from leachable components if composite is inadequately cured, especially near pulp.\n● Clinically, proper cure and finishing reduce unreacted monomer exposure.\n\n## 10) Finishing, Polishing, Surface Sealing (Very exam-friendly)\n\n### Finishing vs Polishing\n\n● Finishing: shaping margins, anatomy, removing overhangs\n● Polishing: smoothing to minimal roughness\n- ● **Finishing**: shaping margins, anatomy, removing overhangs.\n- ● **Polishing**: smoothing to minimal roughness.\n\n### Timing & Technique\n- ● **Excessive dry polishing** → heat → may increase marginal leakage; use water cooling.\n- ● **Timing**: Often best to finish/polish shortly after placement.\n- ● **Surface sealing**: Applying a low-viscosity resin sealer can fill microcracks and reduce microleakage.\n\n---\n\n## 11) Repair of composites\n\n- ● Fresh composite bonds well due to the **oxygen-inhibited layer**.\n- ● Older composite has fewer reactive groups → bond strength drops.\n- ● **Repair strategies**:\n  - ○ surface roughening + etch + bonding resin\n  - ○ silane application to improve bond to exposed filler\n- ● ✅ **Note**: Repaired strength is usually lower than original bulk composite.\n\n---\n\n## 12) Posterior composite selection\n\n### Indications\n- ● Esthetic demand\n- ● Conservative preparations\n- ● Patient without heavy parafunction\n\n### Contraindications / cautions\n- ● **Bruxism** (wear/fracture risk)\n- ● Very large restorations\n- ● High caries activity\n\n---\n\n## 13) Quick Exam Tables (Fast Recall)\n\n### A) Classification by filler size\n\n| Type | Typical Filler Scale | Big Strength | Big Advantage | Big Drawback |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n| Macrofilled | Large (10–50 µm) | Strong | Shrinkage reduced | Rough surface (plucking) |\n| Hybrid / Nanohybrid | Mixed sizes | Strong | "Best balance" | Technique sensitive |\n| Microfilled | 40 nm silica | Lower | Best polish | Lower strength |\n| Nanofilled | <100 nm + clusters | Good | Polish + Strength | Cure depth issues |\n\n### B) Curing types (must memorize)\n\n| Cure Type | Activator (Energy) | Initiator (Chemical) | Pros | Cons |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n| Self-cure | Tertiary Amine | Benzoyl Peroxide | Deep cure; No light needed | No "command set"; Porosity |\n| Light-cure | Blue Light (~470nm) | Camphorquinone (CQ) | "Command set"; Low porosity | Depth limit; High stress |\n| Dual-cure | Light + Chemical | Both systems | Reliable deep cure | Requires mixing |\n| UV-cure (Old) | UV Light | Benzoin Methyl Ether | First "command set" | Limited penetration;
