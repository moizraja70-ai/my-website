Surface dissolution**: The outer layer of each alloy particle dissolves into Hg.\n\n  - ▫️ **2. Hg diffusion inward**: Hg diffuses into the alloy particle at the same time.\n\n  - ▫️ **3. Supersaturation → precipitation**: Once Hg is “too full” of dissolved metals, new Hg-containing crystals precipitate in the Hg.\n\n  - ▫️ **4. Plastic → hard**: At first, Hg is still present as liquid → mass is plastic (packable). As precipitates form, free Hg decreases → mass hardens (sets).\n\n  - ▫️ **5. Unreacted cores remain**: Because Hg is not enough to dissolve all particles, the set amalgam ends up as a composite:\n\n    - ○ Unreacted alloy cores = strong “filler”\n\n    - ○ Reaction products = matrix that binds everything\n\n- ● **Key exam line**: Set amalgam = **unreacted alloy particles embedded in a mercury-containing matrix**.\n\n![How Amalgam Sets (flow diagram)](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_1.png)\n\n- ● (That’s why set amalgam is basically a composite: unreacted particles embedded in a reacted matrix.)\n\n- ● Lets use an analogy glue and rocks\n\n- ● Basically, mercury attacks the surface of the **Ag–Sn (Ag₃Sn)** alloy particles, dissolving silver and tin from the outer layer. These dissolved metals then react with mercury and precipitate as new mercury-containing phases—mainly **Ag₂Hg₃ (γ₁)** and, in low-copper alloys, **Sn₇–₈Hg (γ₂)**.\n\n- ● The **Ag₂Hg₃ (γ₁)** phase forms the main matrix (“good glue”), binding the remaining unreacted **Ag–Sn cores (“rocks”)** together to create the final set amalgam structure.\n\n- ● The **Sn₇–₈Hg (γ₂)** phase is the “bad glue” because it is weak and corrodes easily, so it worsens marginal breakdown over time.\n\n- ● That’s why we add copper: copper pulls tin away from the Sn–Hg route and forms **Cu₆Sn₅ (η′)** instead, so **γ₂** is prevented or eliminated (explained in copper segment).\n\n- ● If u can understand this u can easily understand composite and cements as well as they are the exact same process just different liquids and different rocks (actual rocks lol or u can say glass/silica)\n\n![Oxide Film Disruption → Hg Dissolves Surface → Reaction Products Form](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_3.png)\n\n---\n\n## Amalgamation reaction + phases (this is the “must know”)\n\n- ● **Amalgamation**: mixing liquid mercury with one/more metals/alloys → forms amalgam.\n\n- ● **Trituration**: mechanical mixing of alloy powder + mercury in a triturator (amalgamator).\n\n- ● **Amalgamation reaction + phases (this is the “must know”)**\n\n### Key phase names\n\n- ● **γ (gamma)**: unreacted alloy core **Ag₃Sn**\n\n- ● **γ₁**: matrix **Ag₂Hg₃** (main binder)\n\n- ● **γ₂**: weak/corrosion-prone **Sn₇–₈Hg** (the “bad” phase)\n\n- ● **η′ (eta prime)**: **Cu₆Sn₅** (good corrosion-resistant Cu–Sn product)\n\n![Set Amalgam: A Composite Matrix](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_2.png)\n\n---\n\n## Phase Table (as in your notes)\n\n| Phase Name | Symbol | Formula | Role in the "Rocks and Glue" | Key Properties |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Gamma** | **γ** | **Ag₃Sn** | The "Rocks" (Unreacted Core) | The main component of the strong alloy particle. **strongest phase** |\n| **Epsilon** | **ε** | **Cu₃Sn** | The "Copper Source" (Inside the Rocks) | Found within the alloy particles; it helps supply the copper needed to kill the weak phase. |\n| **Gamma 1** | **γ₁** | **Ag₂Hg₃** | The "Main Glue" (Matrix) | The primary binder that holds the structure together. |\n| **Gamma 2** | **γ₂** | **Sn₇–₈Hg** | The "Weak Glue" (Low-Copper Only) | The weakest phase; unstable, prone to corrosion and creep. |\n| **Eta Prime** | **η′** | **Cu₆Sn₅** | The "Reinforcement" (High-Copper Only) | The reaction product formed when Tin reacts with Copper. |\n\n---\n\n## Low-copper (conventional) setting reaction\n\n- ● **Ag₃Sn + Hg → γ₁ (Ag₂Hg₃) + γ₂ (Sn₇–₈Hg) + unreacted γ**\n\n- ● Final microstructure: unreacted **γ cores** embedded in **γ₁ + γ₂ matrix**.\n\n- ● **γ₂** is weakest + corrodes most → drives marginal breakdown over time.

This effectively blocks the formation of the weak Gamma 2 "bad glue."\n\n- ● This can occur in a single phase reaction or a two phase reaction as discussed below\n\n---\n\n## High-copper types\n\n### A) Admixed high-copper (lathe-cut Ag–Sn + spherical Ag–Cu)\n\n- ● Here 2 compounds are mixed therefore its called admixed\n\n- ● silver-tin and silver-copper\n\n- ● Early: **γ₁ + some γ₂** form\n\n- ● Then tin diffuses to Ag–Cu particles → **η′** forms at their surface\n\n- ● Secondary reaction consumes **γ₂** → **η′** (so **γ₂** ends up minimal/absent)\n\n- ● In this the Sn–Hg is formed and then tin leaves mercury and goes with copper so its a 2 phase reaction\n\n- ● “In admixed high-copper amalgam, γ₂ may form early, but a secondary Cu–Sn reaction converts it into η′, so γ₂ is eliminated.”\n\n- ● Phase 1:\n\n  - ▫️ Reaction: **Ag₃Sn + Hg → Gamma 1 (Ag₂Hg₃) + Gamma 2 (Sn₇–₈Hg)**\n\n- ● Phase 2:\n\n  - ▫️ Reaction: **Gamma 2 + Ag–Cu → Eta-prime (Cu₆Sn₅) η′ + Gamma 1**\n\n- ● The Eta phase surrounds the unreacted core making it more resistant to further mercury attacks\n\n- ● **η′** forms a protective Cu–Sn reaction layer around unreacted cores, reducing **γ₂** formation and improving corrosion/creep resistance.\n\n![The Admixed Reaction: A Two-Step Process](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_5.png)\n\n### B) Single-composition high-copper (often spherical)\n\n- ● No Sn–Hg is formed a single reaction\n\n- ● Forms **γ₁ + η′**, with little/no **γ₂** → excellent creep + corrosion resistance\n\n- ● Benefit vs risk vs admix: better early strength/low creep, but very plastic → contour control issues (proximal overhang/contacts) unless technique is good.\n\n- ●\n\n- ● Extended explanation\n\n### Key Idea\n\n- ● In single-composition high-copper alloys, every single particle contains the copper needed to kill the weak phase.\n\n- ● This copper is stored in the Epsilon phase (**ε**) which is chemically **Cu₃Sn**.\n\n- ● The chemistry is set up so tin reacts with this copper to form Eta-prime (**η′**) instead of forming **Sn–Hg**\n\n- ● We basically add the copper in the silver -tin alloy instead of being a separate compound .\n\n### Single-Composition High-Copper Alloys have NO Weak Phase:\n\n- ● The Setup: In these alloys, the Copper is not a separate ingredient. It is melted directly into the Silver-Tin particle (as the Epsilon phase).\n\n- ● The Release: When Mercury attacks the surface, it dissolves the particle, releasing both Tin and Copper at the exact same spot.\n\n- ● The Race:\n\n  - ▫️ Mercury tries to grab the Tin to form the weak Gamma 2 glue.\n\n  - ▫️ Copper tries to grab the Tin to form the strong Eta-prime crystals.\n\n- ● The Winner: Because the Copper is right there (Proximity) and Tin loves Copper more (Affinity), they snap together instantly.\n\n- ● The Result: The Tin is "stolen" by the Copper before Mercury even has a chance to react with it.\n\n- ● Bottom Line: The reaction is so fast and local that the weak Sn-Hg phase never gets the time to form.\n\n---\n\n## Reaction Summary (The Mechanism)\n\n- ● The Copper Source: The unreacted alloy particles contain Epsilon (**ε**) phase (**Cu₃Sn**) and Gamma (**γ**) phase.\n\n- ● The Reaction **(Ag₃Sn + Cu₃Sn) + Hg → Ag₂Hg₃ + Cu₆Sn₅ + Unreacted Core ((Ag₃Sn + Cu₃Sn))**\n\n- ● Translation: (Gamma + Epsilon) + Mercury → Gamma 1 + Eta-prime + Unreacted Core\n\n- ●\n\n- ● What Forms:\n\n  - ▫️ Gamma 1 (**γ₁**): The main matrix/binder (**Ag₂Hg₃**).\n\n  - ▫️ Eta-prime (**η′**): The Copper–Tin reaction product (**Cu₆Sn₅**).\n\n  - ▫️ Gamma 2 (**γ₂**): Eliminated. Because the Epsilon phase is right there supplying copper, the Tin reacts with it immediately, preventing the weak Sn-Hg phase.\n\n  - ▫️\n\n- ● Final Structure:\n\n- ● Unreacted high-copper alloy particles (containing Gamma and Epsilon) embedded in a Gamma 1 matrix, with Eta-prime crystals dispersed throughout.\n\n---\n\n## Benefit vs. Risk (vs. Admixed High-Copper) EXTRA can skip\n\n| Benefits | Risks / Handling Issues |\n|---|---|\n| Excellent creep resistance (due to Eta-prime locking the matrix) | Fresh mix is very plastic ("mushy") |\n| Better corrosion resistance (No Gamma 2) | Harder to build proximal contour and tight contacts in Class II |\n| Highest early strength (ready in 1 hour) | Higher risk of overhangs if technique is poor |\n\n- ● One-Liner to Memorize\n\n- ● Single-composition particles contain Epsilon phase (**Cu₃Sn**) which reacts to form Gamma 1 + Eta-prime; this eliminates Gamma 2 for low creep/high strength but makes the mix very plastic.\n\n![Mercury Reaction in High-Copper Alloy (Instant Reaction / Final Structure)](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_6.png)\n\n---\n\n## 9) Manipulation (clinical control)\n\n### Mercury/alloy ratio (big clinical lever)\n\n- ● Needs to be enough for a coherent plastic mass after trituration, but not so high that final set has too much weak matrix phase.\n\n- ● Generally it is **1:1**\n\n- ● More Hg → more **γ₁/γ₂ matrix**, less unreacted core → ↓ strength, ↑ creep, ↑ corrosion risk.\n\n- ● Spherical powders generally need less Hg (lower surface area/volume).\n\n![Key Phases in Dental Amalgam (low vs high copper)](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_7.png)\n\n### Trituration (mixing)\n\n- ● Goal: break oxide layer + wet particles so reaction can proceed.\n\n- ● How to know the correct time (critical question):\n\n  - ▫️ Undertriturated: grainy, dull → weak, rough surface\n\n  - ▫️ Proper: cohesive, smooth, shiny “rounded” mass\n\n  - ▫️ Overtriturated: very shiny, mushy, sticks to capsule, shorter working time\n\n### Condensation\n\n- ● Goal: pack dense, adapt to walls, reduce porosity, and express excess Hg.\n\n- ● Key rules from your text + slides:\n\n  - ▫️ Start promptly; keep field absolutely dry\n\n  - ▫️ Condense in increments; each increment should look shiny (Hg at surface helps bond next increment)\n\n  - ▫️ Lathe-cut needs higher pressure; spherical needs less (too much pressure can “punch through”)\n\n- ● When to discard mix (critical question):\n\n- ● If it loses plasticity, becomes difficult to condense, won’t regain a shiny condensed surface, or you start getting voids/layering → discard and triturate fresh.\n\n---\n\n## The Consequences of Improper Manipulation\n\n- ● This covers exactly what happens when you mess up the above variables.\n\n- ● This section is critical for explaining why a restoration fails years later.\n\n### 1. Trituration (Mixing Time & Speed)\n\n| Error Type | Appearance of Mix | Clinical Consequence (The Result) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Under-Trituration (Too Slow/Short) | Grainy, Dull, Crumbly. Like dry sand. | High Porosity: The particles don\'t wet properly, leaving air gaps.<br>Weakness: Voids make it break easily.<br>Corrosion: Rough surface traps plaque.<br>Expansion: Can cause post-op sensitivity. |\n| Normal Mix | Shiny, Smooth. Separates from the capsule in one mass. | Optimal Strength: Minimum voids and proper setting time. |\n| Over-Trituration (Too Fast/Long) | Soupy, Sticky, Shiny. May feel hot to the touch. | Short Working Time: It sets too fast, so you can\'t pack it properly.<br>High Contraction: It shrinks too much, leaving gaps at the margins (leakage).<br>Stickiness: Adheres to instruments, making it hard to handle. |\n\n![Under-trituration vs Normal Mix vs Over-trituration](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_8.png)\n\n### 2. Condensation (Packing Pressure)\n\n- ● The goal of condensation is to adapt the material to the walls and squeeze out excess mercury.\n\n- ● Low Condensation Pressure (Weak Packing):\n\n  - ▫️ High Residual Mercury: You failed to squeeze the extra mercury out. This leaves a "Mercury-Rich" restoration (More Weak Matrix, Less Strong Core).\n\n  - ▫️ Result: Drastic loss of strength and Increased Creep.\n\n  - ▫️ Voids: Leaves air pockets between layers (lamination defects).\n\n- ● Delayed Condensation (Waiting too long):\n\n  - ▫️ The Problem: The matrix crystals have already started to grow and lock.\n\n  - ▫️ The Result: Packing it late fractures these new crystals. The filling will be weak and crumbly because you broke the internal skeleton as it was forming.\n\n![Condensation: Low Pressure vs Delayed Condensation](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_9.png)\n\n### 3. Mercury : Alloy Ratio\n\n- ● Too Much Mercury (**>50%**):\n\n  - ▫️ Microstructure: You create too much Gamma 1 (Glue) and not enough Gamma (Rocks).\n\n  - ▫️ Result: The restoration is Weaker (glue is weaker than rock) and has High Creep (glue moves).\n\n- ● Too Little Mercury (**<45-50%**):\n\n  - ▫️ Microstructure: Not enough liquid to wet the particles.\n\n  - ▫️ Result: A Grainy, Porous mix (similar to under-trituration). The particles don\'t stick together, leading to a rough, pitted surface that corrodes.\n\n![Too Much Mercury vs Too Little Mercury](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_10.png)\n\n### One-Liner Summary for Exam Questions:\n\n- ● Under-trituration = Grainy/Weak/Corrodes.\n\n- ● Over-trituration = Sticky/Shrinks/Sets too fast.\n\n- ● Low Condensation Pressure = Leaves too much Mercury behind (Weak/Creep).\n\n- ● More Mercury = More Weak Matrix.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Properties you must link to causes\n\n### A) Dimensional change (setting)\n\n- ● Amalgam can contract or expand depending mainly on Hg content + condensation.\n\n- ● More Hg remaining when **γ₁ crystals impinge** → expansion\n\n- ● Less Hg / higher condensation pressure / smaller particles / longer trituration → favors net contraction\n\n- ●\n\n![Dimensional Change in Amalgam](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_12.png)\n\n### B) Delayed expansion (Zn + moisture) — the “pain” question\n\n- ● Moisture contamination of Zn-containing amalgam → **H₂ gas** → internal pressure → expansion starting days later and continuing **weeks–months** → can cause severe postoperative pain and protrusion.\n\n- ● So zinc is a double-edged sword (critical question):\n\n  - ▫️ Benefit: deoxidizer → better handling/plasticity\n\n  - ▫️ Risk: if moisture contaminates → delayed expansion (pain)\n\n- ● .\n\n![Zinc in Dental Amalgam: A Double-Edged Sword](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_13.png)\n\n### C) Strength (and why fractures happen)\n\n- ● Amalgam is strong in compression, weak in tension → avoid thin sections/unsupported amalgam.\n\n- ● Strength drops with: bad trituration, delayed condensation, high porosity, high final Hg.\n\n### D) Creep → marginal breakdown (classic chain)\n\n- ● High creep → marginal flow/protrusion → unsupported “flash” fractures → ditched margin.\n\n- ● High-copper has much lower creep mainly because **γ₂** is absent and **η′ strengthens** the structure.\n\n---\n\n## Why it Matters Clinically\n\n- ● why dentists care about that ditch. It’s not just cosmetic; it’s a biological risk.\n\n- ● Plaque Trap: A smooth margin is easy to clean. A "ditched" margin acts like a canyon, trapping food debris and plaque that a toothbrush can\'t reach.\n\n- ● Secondary Decay: Because bacteria sit undisturbed in that ditch, they produce acid, leading to recurrent caries (new decay) right next to the filling.\n\n- ● Corrosion: The deep crevice creates a unique chemical environment that accelerates corrosion, weakening the filling further.\n\n![High creep → marginal flow → flash fracture → ditched margin](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_14.png)\n\n---\n\n## E) Tarnish vs corrosion\n\n- ● Tarnish: surface discoloration (often **Ag sulfide**), not necessarily mechanical failure\n\n- ● Corrosion: property degradation; **γ₂** is the big corrosion-sensitive phase (low-copper worst)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Corrosion: The Structural Destruction\n\n- ● Corrosion is the actual degradation of the material (dissolution of metal) in the bulk of the restoration.\n\n- ● Mechanism: Electrochemical attack (Galvanic Corrosion). The saliva acts as an electrolyte.\n\n- ● The "Battery" Effect Different phases of amalgam have different electrical potentials:\n\n  - ▫️ Cathode (Strong): **γ (Ag–Sn)** and **γ₁ (Ag–Hg)** are noble/strong.\n\n  - ▫️ Anode (Weak): **γ₂ (Sn–Hg)** is the most electronegative (active).\n\n- ● The Failure The **γ₂** phase acts as the anode and is "eaten away" or dissolved.\n\n- ● Consequences\n\n  - ▫️ Porosity: The restoration becomes porous and spongy.\n\n  - ▫️ Weakness: Dramatic loss of strength (**50% strength loss in 5 years** for low-copper amalgam).\n\n  - ▫️ Mercury Release: The mercury from the **γ₂** phase is released back into the restoration, reacting with remaining **γ** to form more **γ₁** and **γ₂** (known as **Mercuroscopic Expansion**).\n\n- ●\n\n- ● Positive side: corrosion products can seal the margin and reduce microleakage over time self sealing ability is due to these products\n\n- ● Here are the corrosion product names:\n\n  - ▫️ Tin Oxide\n\n  - ▫️ Tin Hydroxychloride\n\n  - ▫️ Copper Oxide (found in high-copper amalgams)\n\n  - ▫️ Paratacamite (found in high-copper amalgams)\n\n- ●\n\n- ● \\\\\n\n![Corrosion: battery effect + consequences + corrosion products](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_15.png)\n\n---\n\n## Galvanism (Galvanic Shock)\n\n- ● Definition: A sudden electrical pain caused by a "battery effect" in the mouth.\n\n- ● Requirements:\n\n  - ▫️ 1. Two Different Metals: e.g., Gold Crown (top) vs. Amalgam Filling (bottom).\n\n  - ▫️ 2. Electrolyte: Saliva connects them.\n\n  - ▫️ 3. Contact: Biting down touches the metals together.\n\n- ● Mechanism: When the metals touch, an electrical current flows between them, passing through the tooth and shocking the nerve.\n\n- ● Resolution: The pain usually stops after a few days because the amalgam forms a tarnish layer (oxides), which acts as an insulator and breaks the circuit.\n\n![Galvanic Shock in the Mouth (Oral Battery)](assets/amalgam/amalgam_img_16.png)\n\n---\n\n## 11) Common exam “clinical problems” (answers in note form)\n\n### Pain on chewing 1 day after placement\n\n- ● Most likely:\n\n  - ▫️ High occlusion (hyperocclusion) → adjust occlusion\n\n- ● Tooth cracks from weakened cusps / over-reduction → may need cusp coverage/restoration redesign\n\n- ● Not delayed expansion (that’s usually days later).\n\n### Mechanism of marginal breakdown + prevention\n\n- ● Mechanism: creep + low tensile strength + corrosion at weak/unsupported margins → fracture/ditching.\n\n- ● Prevention:\n\n  - ▫️ Choose high-copper alloy (low creep, no **γ₂**)\n\n  - ▫️ Correct cavity design (avoid unsupported enamel/amalgam)\n\n  - ▫️ Proper trituration + prompt condensation\n\n  - ▫️ Adequate condensation pressure (esp. lathe-cut)\n\n  - ▫️ Remove Hg-rich surface layer; proper carving; finish/polish appropriately\n\n---\n\n## 12) Mercury safety (short, factual, exam-safe)\n\n- ● Allergy to mercury/amalgam is rare; true hypersensitivity needs clinical confirmation.\n\n- ● Major reviews generally find no clear link between amalgam and systemic illness in the general population; agencies still advise precautionary minimization for certain groups.\n\n- ● Quantifiable exposure: studies/reviews often estimate a few µg/day of absorbed mercury from amalgams, generally below tolerable daily intakes used by regulators/WHO frameworks.\n\n- ● Office hygiene: encapsulated systems, good ventilation, high-volume suction + water spray during removal, avoid dry polishing (highest vapor release), proper scrap disposal.\n\n',n='\n## 1) Core definitions (high-yield)\n\n- ● **Amalgam**: an alloy that contains **mercury** (**Ag–Sn(silver–tin) + mercury**).\n- ● **Amalgamation**: mixing **liquid mercury** with **one/more metals/alloys** → forms **amalgam**.
