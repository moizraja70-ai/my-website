const e="\n# Dental Waxes\n\nThe only wax that requires detail is the inlay wax other u have to remember uses mostly and\nsome properties\n\n**Inlay wax**: The wax used to make the wax pattern (positive replica) of a restoration; this\npattern is then invested and burned out to create a negative mold for casting.\n\n![Inlay Wax Overview](assets/images/wax/wax_pdf_img_1.png)\n\n## Inlay wax (Pattern wax) — complete topic\n\n### 1) What inlay wax actually does (core concept)\n- **Inlay wax is a pattern wax** → you build a positive wax pattern of the restoration (inlay/onlay/crown, etc.).\n- That wax pattern is invested (surrounded by investment).\n- Then wax is burned out → leaves a negative mold space inside the investment.\n- Molten alloy (or pressed ceramic in some systems) fills that space → **final restoration can only be as accurate as the wax pattern**.\n\n![Pattern Process](assets/images/wax/wax_pdf_img_2.png)\n\n![Pattern Example](assets/images/wax/wax_pdf_img_3.png)\n\n\n### 2) Where it fits in classification\nDental waxes can be classified:\n\n**By use location**\n- **Clinical**: bite registration wax, disclosing wax, utility wax, Type I inlay wax (direct technique; low melting; used in mouth).\n- **Laboratory**: boxing wax, baseplate wax, sticky wax, beading wax, utility wax, Type II inlay wax (indirect technique; used on die/model).\n\n**By function**\n- **Pattern wax/modeling waxes**: inlay wax, casting wax, baseplate wax\n- **Processing wax**: boxing, utility, sticky\n- **Impression wax**: bite registration/corrective\n\n✅ **Inlay wax belongs to pattern waxes.**\n✅ **Type II wax is required for lost-wax processing of cast prostheses/frameworks.**\n\n---\n\n### 3) Composition (what’s inside + why) IMP\n- **Paraffin (~40–60%)** → main body; moldable but flakes and lacks smooth/gloss alone.\n- **Gum dammar (dammar resin)** → improves smoothness, ↑ toughness, ↓ cracking/flaking, improves luster.\n- **Carnauba wax** → very hard, high MP → reduces flow at mouth temperature, adds gloss.\n- **Candelilla wax** → can replace carnauba partly/fully (similar effect; lower MP; less hard).\n- **Ceresin** → improves toughness + carving behavior (may replace part of paraffin).\n- **Synthetic waxes** (compatible with paraffin) → more uniform; allow better working characteristics.\n- **Coloring agents** → contrast with tooth/die/model; helps margin carving.\n- **Fillers (sometimes)** → help control expansion/shrinkage; must burn out cleanly.\n\n#### The few constituents that matter (exam logic)\n**High-yield**: different waxes are basically the same “base wax” recipe, but you shift the % of key constituents to force the behavior you want (tacky vs hard vs pliable vs low-flow).\n\nHere’s the high-yield “ingredient → effect → which wax uses more of it”:\n\n**1) Paraffin (hydrocarbon base)**\n- More paraffin → more moldable/flowy, but also more shrinkage + more flaking/brittleness if it’s “too pure.”\n- ✅ Used in most waxes as the main body (often ~40–60% in inlay wax).\n\n**2) Hardeners (Carnauba > Candelilla)**\n- More carnauba/candelilla → harder, higher melting range, lower flow at mouth temp, more gloss, but can become more brittle.\n- ✅ “Hardness + low mouth-flow” waxes use more of this.\n\n**3) Tougheners / anti-flake modifiers**\n- Dammar resin (gum dammar) / microcrystalline wax / ceresin\n- More dammar → smoother surface + tougher, less cracking/flaking\n- More microcrystalline/ceresin → tougher, less brittle, better carving/adaptation than paraffin alone\n- ✅ Waxes that must carve nicely or not chip use more of these.\n\n**4) Tackifier resin (Rosin / sticky resins)**\n- More rosin → very tacky when melted, brittle when cooled (classic sticky wax behavior).\n- ✅ **Sticky wax = high rosin** (this is the big differentiator).\n\n**5) Plasticizers (often Beeswax / soft wax fractions)**\n- More beeswax/soft fractions → more pliable, easier to adapt at room temp, but more distortion/flow at mouth temp if excessive.\n- ✅ Used in waxes that need to be soft and adaptable.\n\n**6) Fillers (sometimes added)**\n- More filler → stiffer, less thermal distortion/shrink, can improve handling (common idea in bite reg waxes).\n- ✅ Used where dimensional stability is critical.\n\n#### Now apply it: “If you want this wax… increase these”\n\n**Sticky wax**\n- Goal: tacky when hot, locks parts when cool\n- Main use: Hold metal parts together before soldering (also holds broken denture parts/model pieces temporarily).\n- ● ↑ Rosin / tackifying resins (main difference)\n- ● Moderate base wax (paraffin/microcrystalline)\n- ● Low plasticizer (so it becomes brittle/firm when cooled)\n\n**Inlay wax (pattern wax) ← must do**\n- Goal: accurate pattern, low flow at mouth temp, good carving, clean burnout\n- ● ↑ Paraffin base\n- ● ↑ Carnauba (hardener) to reduce mouth-temp flow\n- ● ↑ Dammar resin to reduce flaking + improve smoothness/gloss\n- ● Sometimes ↑ ceresin/microcrystalline for toughness/carvability\n- **Type I (direct)**: generally tuned for lower flow at 37°C (so “more hardener / higher-MP fractions” idea).\n- **Type II (indirect)**: comes soft/medium/hard depending on how much hardener/toughener is used.\n\n**Boxing wax**\n- Goal: soft, pliable sheet, seals around impression\n- ● ↑ Plasticizer/soft wax fractions (more pliable)\n- ● Often ↑ microcrystalline for smooth bending without cracking\n- ● Low carnauba (you don’t want it hard)\n- ● Small resin content helps it “self-seal” when pressed\n\n**Baseplate wax**\n- Goal: stable record base + rim form (dentures)\n- ● ↑ Paraffin/ceresin base (major portion)\n- ● ↑ Beeswax/resins to control flow and handling\n- ● Hard/medium/soft types = mostly by shifting hardener vs plasticizer\n\n**Utility wax**\n- Goal: very adaptable at room temp for tray borders\n- ● ↑ microcrystalline + plasticizers (very pliable)\n- ● Low hardeners (otherwise it won’t adapt easily)\n\n**Bite registration (impression) wax**\n- Goal: records occlusion with minimal rebound/distortion after removal\n- ● Often ↑ fillers and stability modifiers\n- ● Controlled flow: soft enough at mouth temp to record, rigid enough at room temp to hold shape\n\n---\n\n### 4) Types (Type I vs Type II)\n- **Type I inlay wax (Direct technique)**\n  - Used in the mouth\n  - Must have very low flow at 37°C so it can be carved/removed without distortion.\n- **Type II inlay wax (Indirect technique)**\n  - Used on die/model\n  - Comes as soft/medium/hard varieties; used for lost-wax patterns made outside the mouth.\n\n### 5) Flow (most tested property)\nWhy flow matters: too much flow → distortion and wrong fit.\n\n**Type I**\n- 37°C: max 1%\n- 45°C: 70–90%\n\n**Type II**\n- 30°C: max 1%\n- 37°C: max 50%\n- 45°C: 70–90%\n\n**Meaning (exam logic):**\n- At 45°C, wax must flow a lot → to adapt into fine details.\n- At 37°C, Type I must barely flow → so the pattern doesn’t distort while carving/removing in the mouth.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Thermal properties (why direct technique is tricky)\n- **Low thermal conductivity** → wax heats/cools unevenly unless given time.\n- **High coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)** → tiny temperature changes = big dimensional change (**largest among dental materials**).\n  - Wax may expand ~0.7% with +20°C\n  - May contract ~0.35% cooling 37°C → 25°C\n- Glass transition region (~35°C) in paraffin-rich waxes → expansion/plasticity behavior changes around here.\n- ✅ This is less significant in indirect technique because the pattern isn’t going mouth → room temp.\n\n### 7) Wax distortion (common causes)\nWax patterns distort due to:\n- Physical deformation during molding/carving/removal\n- Trapped stresses from cooling/manipulation\n- Elastic memory\n- Occluded air\n- Excess storage time (stress relaxation)\n- Temperature extremes/changes during storage/handling\n\n**Key rule**: best fit occurs when a pattern is **invested immediately** after removal.\n\n### 8) Burnout requirement (must know)\n- Wax must be eliminated completely from the mold during burnout.\n- If wax leaves residue/impervious coating → casting quality and fit suffer.\n- Ideal: at ~500°C, residue should be **≤0.10%** of original wax weight.\n\n### 9) The classic “critical question” (direct vs indirect fit)\n**Why can a direct wax pattern produce a looser inlay than indirect?**\n- Because in direct technique the pattern is formed at mouth temperature, then removed and cools to room temperature causing thermal contraction + stress release (elastic memory) → distortion/shrinkage → inaccurate pattern → poorer fit.\n",a="\n# Wax (Summary)\n\n## Key Definitions\n- **Pattern Wax**: Used to create the mold (e.g., Inlay Wax).\n- **Processing Wax**: Used to aid laboratory steps (e.g., Boxing Wax).\n- **Impression Wax**: Used to record bites (e.g., Aluwax).\n\n## Composition Highlights\n- **Paraffin**: Main ingredient (40-60%).\n- **Carnauba**: Hardener + Gloss.\n- **Dammar**: Toughener + Smoothness.\n\n## Critical Exam Points\n- **CTE**: Highest of ALL dental materials (expands/contracts the most).\n- **Conductivity**: Very low (insulator).
