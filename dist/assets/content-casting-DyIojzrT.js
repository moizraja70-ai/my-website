const e='\n# Casting Procedure\n\n![Casting Procedure Overview](assets/investment/investment_img_1_1.png)\n\n# Dental Casting (Lost-Wax)\n## The BIG GOAL (why we do all this)\nA casting fits only if the mold is enlarged enough to compensate for:\n- Wax pattern changes (minor, variable)\n- Alloy solidification shrinkage (major; noble ≈ ~1.25%+, base metals≈ ~ 2.2% )\n\n## Alloy Solidification Shrinkage (Major, Predictable)\nThis is the most important factor.\n### 🔹 Why does metal shrink?\n- Molten metal atoms are far apart\n- On cooling and solidification, atoms pack closer together\n- This causes volume contraction\n### 🔹 Typical shrinkage values:\n- **Noble alloys (gold-based)**: ≈ 1.25%\n- **Base-metal alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr)**: ≈ 2.0–2.3% (≈ 2.2%)\n\n👉 Base metals shrink more because:\n- Higher melting temperature\n- Greater thermal contraction\n\n![Shrinkage Compensation](assets/investment/casting_img_2.png)\n\nWe cannot control this shrinkage so what we do is we counter it by making the investment expand which we already learned in investment material by thermal expansion and hygroscopic expansion\n\n**Investment expansion +2.2% - (Metal shrinkage )2.2%-=0**\n\n**Total Investment Expansion = Metal Casting Shrinkage**\n- Example: If the metal shrinks by 2.2%, the mold must expand by 2.2%.\n- Result: The expansion (+2.2%) cancels out the shrinkage (-2.2%), resulting in a net change of 0.\nIf this is mismatched by any percentage we get either undersized or oversized casting\n\n# 1) Lost-Wax Casting Procedure — FLOW CHART (what happens step-by-step)\n**Impression**\n-> **Master cast + Master die** (Type IV / Type V stone)\n-> **Wax/resin pattern made on die** (margins/contacts/occlusion corrected)\n-> **Sprue + reservoir added** (creates metal channel + feeding source)\n-> **Investing** (pattern surrounded by investment in ring / ringless system) (a separate slide )\n-> **Bench set (~1 hour)** (investment hardens)\n-> **Burnout / Wax elimination + heating** (wax removed, mold expanded, water driven off)\n-> **Casting** (molten alloy forced into mold: centrifugal / pressure / vacuum+pressure)\n-> **Cooling** (then divest)\n-> **Cleaning** (pickling / ultrasonic / sandblast as appropriate)\n-> **Finish + fit check** (remove nodules, check margins under magnification)\n\n# 2) Master die\nMost commonly used:\n- **Type IV stone**: high strength, setting expansion ≤0.1%\n- **Type V stone**: high strength, higher expansion up to ~0.3% (helps compensate base-metal shrinkage)\n\n**Main disadvantage of gypsum dies**: abrasion during wax carving.\nWays to increase abrasion resistance (but can slightly increase die size):\n- Silver “plating” / electroforming approaches\n- Cyanoacrylate coating\n- Die hardener addition\n\n**Die spacer (for cement space)**:\n- Usually resin paint-on; applied in coats to within ~0.5 mm of finish line\n\n**Electroformed dies (metal shell on impression)**:\n- Very abrasion-resistant + accurate surface reproduction\n- “Silver-plated die” is technically wrong wording because the impression surface is plated, not the die itself.\n\n# 3) Sprue design — the highest-yield principles MUST\n**Purpose of sprue former**: channel for molten alloy to reach mold after wax elimination.\n\n## 6.1 Sprue diameter\n- Sprue diameter ≈ thickest part of wax pattern\n- Too small → sprue freezes first → localized shrinkage / suck-back near attachment\n\n## 6.2 Sprue position + direction\n- Attach to bulkiest area\n- Best if metal flows thick → thin (toward margins) rather than thin → thick\n- Avoid directing molten metal toward thin/delicate parts (may abrade/fracture investment)\n\n## 6.3 Sprue angle (turbulence rule)\n- Avoid attaching at 90° to broad flat surfaces → turbulence → severe porosity at attachment\n- Prefer ~45° to proximal wall for smoother flow + less porosity\n\n## 6.4 Sprue attachment shape\n- Often flared for high-density gold alloys (helps entry like reservoir)\n- Sometimes more restricted for lower-density alloys\n\n## 6.5 Sprue length + pattern position (the “6 mm” rule)\n- Pattern should be positioned close to ring end so gases vent:\n    - **Gypsum-bonded**: top of pattern within ~6 mm of open end\n    - **Phosphate-bonded**: can be closer (~3–4 mm) due to higher strength\n\n![Sprue Design](assets/investment/casting_img_3.png)\n\n## 6.6 Reservoir (feeding rule)\n- Reservoir/button must remain molten longer than the pattern so it can feed metal during solidification → prevents shrinkage voids.\n\n![Reservoir Concept](assets/investment/casting_img_4.png)\n\n# 7) Rings, ring liners, and “Ringless” systems detail is unnecessary\n## 7.1 Why liner is used\nMetal ring restricts investment expansion → can distort mold.\nRing liner provides cushioning → allows investment expansion.\n\n## 7.2 Liner materials\n- Asbestos is obsolete (biohazard)\n- Alternatives: cellulose (paper) and ceramic liner\n\n## 7.3 One liner vs two liners\n- More liner thickness (or two layers) → more normal + semihygroscopic expansion\n- Liner thickness should not be < ~1 mm\n- Liner must fit with no overlap (overlap = nonuniform expansion)\n\n## 7.4 Wet liner vs dry liner\n- Wet liner adds water during set → increases semihygroscopic expansion\n- Don’t squeeze liner (uneven water removal → nonuniform expansion)\n\n## 7.5 Controlling excessive longitudinal expansion\n- Expansion is greater longitudinally than radially\n- Keeping liner slightly short of ring ends (example ~3.25 mm short) can reduce longitudinal over-expansion and distortion.\n\n## 7.6 Ringless (“Ingl(e)ss”) / PowerCast style concept\n- Tapered plastic rings allow the set mold to be pushed out after setting\n- Burnout occurs without rigid metal ring → greater investment expansion\n- Used for cases needing more mold expansion than traditional techniques.\n\n# 8) Crucibles (what to choose)\n- **Clay**: many crown/bridge noble alloys\n- **Carbon**: many gold-based alloys (NOT for carbon-sensitive alloys)\n- **Quartz / alumina / zirconia-alumina**: recommended for high-fusing alloys and carbon-sensitive alloys\n- Carbon crucible should NOT be used for: high-Pd, Pd-Ag, Ni-Cr, Co-Cr alloys (carbon contamination risk)\n\n![Crucibles](assets/investment/casting_img_5.png)\n\n# 8) Mixing + investing procedure (what causes nodules/roughness)\n\n## 8.1 Cleaning wax pattern\n- Must be cleaned of debris/grease/oil\n- Thin film of cleaner/wetting agent improves wetting → fewer bubbles\n\n## 8.2 Vacuum mixing/investing (high yield)\n- Vacuum mixing removes bubbles → smoother surface, fewer nodules\n- Excessive vibration is bad → solids settle + free water near pattern → roughness\n- Excessive vibration can dislodge pattern from sprue → miscast\n\n## 8.3 Liquid/powder ratio (L/P or W/P)\n- Higher W/P (more water) → weaker investment, more porosity, rougher casting, generally less effective expansion\n- Lower W/P → thicker mix, potentially more expansion BUT too thick risks pattern distortion + poor coverage\n- Measure accurately.\n\n![Vacuum Mixing](assets/investment/casting_img_6.png)\n\n# 9) Burnout (wax elimination + heating) — what happens + how it’s done\n\n## 9.1 What burnout accomplishes\n- Eliminates wax → creates mold cavity\n- Provides thermal expansion(detail in investment material )\n- Drives off water; reduces wax absorption; water vapor helps flush wax from mold\n- If mold is held too long at high temp: risk of investment breakdown + rough surface + contamination\n\n![Burnout Oven](assets/investment/casting_img_7.png)\n\n## 9.2 Orientation in furnace (practical)\n- Often place ring sprue hole down over a slot/tray so melted wax drains.\n\n## 9.3 Two main compensation techniques\n### A) Hygroscopic / Low-heat method (gypsum)\n- Compensation from:\n    1. Wax expansion in warm water bath (~37°C)\n    2. Hygroscopic expansion from water entering investment\n    3. Thermal expansion at ~500°C\n- Requires longer burnout time because wax oxidizes slower at low temp\n- Typical: mold in furnace ≥60 min, can be held longer with little damage, but venting may reduce if residual carbon remains → back-pressure risk.\n\n### B) High-heat / Thermal expansion method (gypsum)\n- Heat from room temp up to ~650–700°C (controlled heating to avoid cracking)\n- Hold at top temperature (short hold) then cast promptly\n- Gypsum is more prone to decomposition if overheated.\n\n## 9.4 Gypsum investment temperature ceiling (critical)\n- Gypsum investments should not be heated above **~700°C**\n- If gypsum investment contains carbon, safe maximum may be lower (often around **~650°C**)\n- Above limits → sulfur gases + contamination → black/gray brittle layer on gold alloy; difficult to pickle clean.\n\n## 9.5 Phosphate investment burnout (high heat)\n- Typical burnout temperatures: **~750°C to 1030°C** (highest for base metals)\n- Often staged heating: slow early (e.g., 200–315°C hold) then faster, then hold at top temp (~30 min), then cast.\n- Phosphate investment permeability is lower than gypsum → often requires greater casting pressure.\n\n## 9.6 “Cast soon after removing ring” (time allowable)\n- Investment contracts as it cools.\n- In high-heat technique, about **~1 minute** can pass without noticeable dimensional loss under average conditions → then contraction matters.\n\n# 10) Casting machines\nAlloys melted and cast by:\n1. Torch melting → centrifugal casting\n2. Electrical resistance or induction melting → centrifugal\n3. Induction melting (often for base metals)\n4. Vacuum-arc melted + pressure casting in inert atmosphere (esp. reactive metals like Ti)\n\n![Casting Machines](assets/investment/casting_img_8.png)\n\n# 11) Torch flame + melting\n\n## 11.1 Proper flame\n- Use a nonluminous brush flame (efficient/hot)\n- Beginners often choose roaring “too much air” flame (sounds hot but is wrong)\n\n## 11.2 Flame zones (must know)\n- **Mixing zone**: no heat\n- **Combustion/oxidizing zone**: oxidizes alloy → dross (keep away)\n- **Reducing zone**: hottest usable zone → should contact alloy during melting\n- Outer oxidizing area should not be used for melting.\n\n![Flame Zones](assets/investment/casting_img_9.png)\n\n## 11.3 Signs you’re using wrong zone\n- **Correct reducing zone** → metal surface bright/mirrorlike\n- **Oxidizing zone** → dull cloudy oxide film (“dross”)\n\n## 11.4 Casting temperature rule\n- Cast immediately when proper temp reached\n- For many noble alloys: molten alloy should be **~38–66°C** above liquidus\n\n## 11.5 Flux (noble alloys)\n- Flux increases fluidity and reduces oxidation/porosity\n- Borax + boric acid is classic\n- Reducing fluxes with charcoal can shed carbon bits → margin defects\n\n# 13) Cleaning after casting\n\n## 13.1 Quenching (noble alloys)\n- For type III/IV gold: quench when button shows **dull-red glow**\nThe button is the rounded mass of excess metal at the end of the sprue, near the crucible former, after casting\n\n![Quenching 1](assets/investment/casting_img_10.png)\n![Quenching 2](assets/investment/casting_img_11.png)\n\n- Anneals metal (easier burnish/polish)(detail in metals )\n- Hot investment breaks down → easier removal(thermal shock )\n**Too hot (bright red) quench** → over-annealing + distortion;\n**too cold (fully cooled) quench** → hard alloy(no annealing occurs ) + difficult divesting;(no thermal shock to break the investment)\n**dull-red button** → ideal anneal + easy divesting.\nIf the metal is too hot and it is quench in water it can leads to Metal fins on casting\n\n![Metal Fins](assets/investment/casting_img_12.png)\n\n## 13.2 Pickling (removes oxides/discoloration)\n- Often surface dark from oxides/tarnish → remove by acid pickling\n- Common for gypsum-bonded: ~50% HCl (effective but fumes hazardous/corrosive; needs ventilation)\n- Don’t boil acids (fumes)\n\n**Important mistake to avoid (high yield):**\n- **Never use steel tongs** in pickling solution while holding casting → galvanic cell deposits copper on casting → future discoloration.\n\n## 13.3 Phosphate investment cleanup\n- Investment adheres strongly; large quartz grains\n- HCl/H₂SO₄(cannot use it )\n- Neither phosphate binder nor silica is soluble in\n- HF(used to etch ceramic ) dissolves silica but is dangerous (often avoided); safer commercial alternatives exist\n- Base metal alloys: prefer sandblasting with fine alumina, avoid acids.\n\n# 14) Casting defects (most testable) — types, causes, prevention\n\n![Casting Defects](assets/investment/casting_img_13.png)\n\n## A) Distortion\n- Usually wax pattern distortion (handling/removal)\n- Also nonuniform investment expansion can distort thin patterns\n- Lower setting expansion generally → less distortion (but expansion still needed overall)\n\n## B) Surface roughness / irregularities / discoloration\nCommon causes:\n- Air voids on pattern → nodules (fix: vacuum investing, good wetting)\n- Water films from investment separating from wax (jarring after investing)\n- High W/P ratio → rough casting\n- Coarse silica → rougher surface\n- Foreign bodies in mold (bits of investment, carbon from flux)\n- Sulfur contamination → black/gray brittle layer on gold alloy; doesn’t pickle clean\n\n## C) Porosity (internal + external)\nTwo big groups:\n1. **Solidification defects**\n    - Localized shrinkage porosity\n    - Microporosity\n    - Suck-back porosity (hot spot)\n2. **Trapped gases**\n    - Pinhole porosity\n    - Gas inclusions\n    - Subsurface porosity\n    - Back-pressure porosity\n\n### 1) Localized shrinkage porosity\n- **What**: a shrinkage void caused by poor “feeding” of molten metal during solidification.(basically the metal freezes/solidifies before it flows to all places )\n- **Why**: metal shrinks as it freezes; if the sprue/button freezes before the casting, liquid metal can’t flow in to compensate → void forms.\n- **Where/looks like**: irregular voids, often near the sprue–casting junction or thick areas.\n- **Prevent**: sprue thick enough, attach to thickest part, add reservoir/button, correct casting temperature.\n\n### 2) Microporosity\n- **What**: many tiny internal pores within thick sections.\n- **Why**: the surface freezes first; inside becomes a “mushy zone” of dendrites, and the last liquid metal can’t feed the shrinkage → tiny pores remain.\n- **Where/looks like**: fine internal porosity in bulky areas; not always visible until sectioned/ground.\n- **Prevent**: correct sprue + reservoir, avoid too-rapid freezing, maintain proper casting temperature and pressure.\n\n### 3) Suck-back porosity (hot spot)\n- **What**: a shrinkage void from a localized hot region that freezes last.\n- **Why**: metal impinges at sprue junctions or sharp line angles, creating a hot spot; that area solidifies last and “pulls back” → void.\n- **Where/looks like**: usually just inside casting near sprue attachment or near sharp internal angles; often a smooth void.\n- **Prevent**: flare sprue attachment, round sharp line angles, correct sprue placement, avoid excessive mold/melt temp.\n\n### 4) Trapped gases\n- **What**: gas/air physically stuck in the mold or melt → rounded voids.\n- **Why**: turbulence, poor venting, moisture/wax residues creating gas, inadequate pressure/flow.\n- **Where/looks like**: rounded pores; may be scattered; can cause short castings.\n- **Prevent**: smooth metal flow (proper sprue), complete burnout, dry mold, adequate pressure.\n\n### 5) Pinhole porosity\n- **What**: tiny surface pinholes.\n- **Why**: gas in molten metal escapes at/near the surface during freezing (often from overheating, contamination, wrong flame, dirty alloy/crucible).\n- **Where/looks like**: many small pin-point holes on surface after finishing.\n- **Prevent**: don’t overheat, clean alloy/crucible, proper flux, controlled melting, avoid prolonged heating.\n\n### 6) Gas inclusions\n- **What**: larger rounded bubbles trapped inside the casting.\n- **Why**: air/gas gets entrained during melting/casting (turbulence, splashing, contamination).\n- **Where/looks like**: larger smooth round internal voids (bigger than pinholes).\n- **Prevent**: avoid turbulence, correct sprueing, steady casting pressure, clean melt.\n\n### 7) Subsurface porosity\n- **What**: pores just below the surface (appear after grinding/polishing).\n- **Why**: gas dissolves in molten metal; as it cools, gas solubility drops → gas comes out beneath a frozen surface skin.\n- **Where/looks like**: looks fine initially, then pores show on finishing.\n- **Prevent**: avoid overheating, minimize melt time, protect melt from gas pickup.\n\n### 8) Back-pressure porosity\n- **What**: rounded porosity + often incomplete casting due to “air pushing back.”\n- **Why**: air in mold can’t escape through investment because investment is too dense or pores are clogged (carbon from incomplete burnout, moisture). Incoming metal meets resistance → voids/short margins.\n- **Where/looks like**: rounded porosity + rounded incomplete margins / missing thin parts.\n- **Prevent**: correct investment mix (good permeability), complete burnout, keep pattern ~6 mm from ring end/wall, adequate casting pressure/time.\n\n## Shrinkage Porosity (The "Feeding" Problem)\n**Cause**: Metal shrinks as it cools. If new liquid metal cannot reach the shrinking area, a vacuum void forms.\n\n| Type | Visual Cues | Key Mechanism |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Localized Shrinkage** | Irregular shapes (jagged). Usually near the sprue-casting junction. | **Sprue froze too early.** The supply line was cut off while the casting was still thirsty for metal. |\n| **Microporosity** | Tiny, fine voids throughout a thick section, often invisible until polished. | **Dendritic growth.** The "mushy zone" inside a thick chunk froze before liquid could fill the gaps between crystals. |\n| **Suck-back (Hot Spot)** | Smooth void, often just inside the casting near the sprue or sharp line angle. | **Hot Spot.** The metal hit a sharp corner, overheated that spot, and that spot froze last, sucking metal back toward the sprue. |\n\n## Gas Porosity (The "Trapped Air" Problem)\n**Cause**: Gas (air, combustion products, or dissolved gas) is physically trapped inside the metal.\n\n| Type | Visual Cues | Key Mechanism |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Pinhole Porosity** | Tiny spherical holes all over the surface. | **Gas release.** The metal was overheated or contaminated; gas dissolved in the liquid and bubbled out right as it froze. |\n| **Gas Inclusions** | Larger rounded bubbles inside the metal. | **Turbulence.** Poor sprue design caused the metal to splash and trap air pockets, or debris released gas. |\n| **Subsurface Porosity** | Hidden voids that appear only after polishing/grinding. | **Solubility drop.** Gas was trapped just under the frozen "skin" of the casting. |\n| **Back-pressure Porosity** | Rounded voids + Rounded margins (incomplete casting). | **No Escape.** The air in the mold couldn\'t get out (investment too dense or pattern too deep). The air fought back against the metal. |\n',n=["Casting involves forcing molten alloy into a mold cavity.","Stages: Wax pattern, Spruing, Investing, Burnout, Casting.","Expansion of the mold must perfectly compensate for alloy shrinkage.","Venting is necessary to allow gases to escape the mold."],t=[],i=[{id:"cast_mcq_set2_1",question:"Cleaning after casting (base metals) A cast restoration made from a Ni-Cr alloy needs cleaning after divesting.
