Other variations are discussed later.\n\n### C) Sturdevant classification (“By formulation / modification style”)\n\n- ● Traditional / Conventional GIC.\n\n- ● Metal-modified GIC:\n  - ▫️ (a) **Cermet**\n  - ▫️ (b) **Miracle Mix**\n\n- ● Light-cured GIC.\n\n- ● Hybrid (**Resin-modified GIC**).\n\n- ● Polyacid-modified resin composite (**Compomer**).\n\n- ● Note: Sturdevant here is basically telling you the “family tree” of GIC modifications.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Chemistry and setting (conventional GIC)\n\n### A) “Same chemistry across types—different powder/particle size”\n\n- ● Chemistry is essentially the same across types **I–III**.\n\n- ● Variations are mainly in:\n  - ▫️ Powder composition.\n  - ▫️ Particle size.\n  - ▫️ **P/L ratio** (powder/liquid ratio).\n\n- ● Consistency varies widely among manufacturers:\n  - ▫️ Low viscosity → very flowable mixes.\n  - ▫️ High viscosity → packable mixes.\n\n- ● Typical particle sizes by indication:\n  - ▫️ Restorative: larger particles (**~50 µm**).\n  - ▫️ Luting: finer particles (**~15 µm**).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Composition (IMP)\n\n### A) Glass (powder) composition: what’s inside and why\n\n- ● The glass composition varies among manufacturers, but always includes:\n  - ▫️ **Silica**\n  - ▫️ **Calcia**\n  - ▫️ **Alumina**\n  - ▫️ **Fluoride**\n\n- ● Key concept: the **alumina : silica ratio** is critical for reactivity with polyacrylic acid.\n\n- ● To increase radiopacity, add higher atomic number metal oxides (e.g., **barium**, **strontium**).\n\n- ● It is **fluoroaluminosilicate glass**.\n\n### B) Liquid composition (conventional vs modern) (IMP)\n\n- ● Older liquids:\n  - ▫️ Aqueous polyacrylic acid solutions (**~40–50%**).\n  - ▫️ Problems:\n    - ○ High viscosity.\n    - ○ Short shelf life (gelation).\n\n- ● Current liquids (common modern approach):\n  - ▫️ Copolymers of:\n    - ○ **Itaconic acid**\n    - ○ **Maleic acid**\n    - ○ **Tricarboxylic acids**\n  - ▫️ These improve stability/handling compared with early polyacrylic acid-only liquids.\n\n### C) Tartaric acid (rate-controlling additive): what it does (list exactly)\n\n- ● **Tartaric acid**:\n  - ▫️ Allows a wider range of glasses to be used.\n  - ▫️ Improves handling.\n  - ▫️ Decreases viscosity.\n  - ▫️ Lengthens shelf life before gelation.\n  - ▫️ Increases working time.\n  - ▫️ Shortens setting time.\n\n- ● **Itaconic acid**\n  - ▫️ Promotes glass–liquid reactivity.\n  - ▫️ Prevents gelation of polyacrylic acid liquid (improves shelf stability).\n\n- ● **Maleic acid**\n  - ▫️ Stronger acid effect → helps the cement harden faster and become less moisture sensitive earlier.\n\n- ● **Tartaric acid (HIGH-YIELD)**:\n  - ▫️ Controls the “speed profile” of setting by affecting pH and glass dissolution rate.\n  - ▫️ In practice gives better handling; described as controlling pH during setting and typically increasing working time.\n  - ▫️ Acts as a temporary “decoy” to delay hardening so you have time to mix (working time), then triggers a rapid “snap set” once it is used up (setting time).\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 7) Setting reaction (what happens after mixing powder + liquid) (IMP)\n\n### A) Water is CRITICAL (two roles)\n\n- ● Water is not “just a solvent”:\n  - ▫️ **1) Reaction medium**\n    - ○ Ions released from glass need an aqueous phase to move and react.\n  - ▫️ **2) Part of the set structure (maturation)**\n    - ○ The matrix becomes a hydrated gel over time; early water imbalance disrupts the matrix formation.\n\n- ● That’s why early contamination/dehydration can destroy surface integrity.\n\n### B) Critical role of water (exam framing)\n\n- ● Water is essential, but it must be carefully balanced:\n  - ▫️ **Function:** Water hydrates the salts, allows cross-linking, and acts as the medium for cation transport.\n  - ▫️ **Balance:**\n    - ○ Too much water dilutes ions → weak, opaque restoration.\n    - ○ Too little water → desiccation → cracking and “crazing”.\n  - ▫️ **Types of water:**\n    - ○ Loosely bound: easily lost to desiccation.\n    - ○ Tightly bound: part of the hydration shell; as this increases with aging, it improves the strength and modulus of elasticity of the base.\n\n- ● **GIC—Why Water is Critical (balance + types of water):**\n\n![Critical Role of Water](/assets/critical_role_of_water_step_by_step_ion_release_cross_linking_maturation_1.png)\n\n### C) Step-by-step (ion release → cross-linking → maturation)\n\n- ● **Step 1: Acid attack on glass surface (DECOMPOSITION)**\n  - ▫️ Polyacid releases **H⁺** that attacks the glass surface → glass dissolves at reactive sites.\n\n- ● **Step 2: Ion release (“leaching”) (Migration)**\n  - ▫️ Glass releases ions into the aqueous medium:\n    - ○ **Ca²⁺**, **Al³⁺**, plus **Na⁺** and **F⁻**\n\n- ● **Step 3: Early cross-linking (initial set) (Gelation)**\n  - ▫️ **Ca²⁺** first cross-links the carboxylate groups (**–COO⁻**) on polyacrylic acid chains → forms calcium polyacrylate gel network (initial hardening).\n\n- ● **Setting Reaction Diagram:**\n\n![Final Set Microstructure](/assets/final_set_microstructure_what_the_set_cement_is_1.png)\n\n- ● **Step 4: Post-set hardening / maturation / strengthening**\n  - ▫️ Over time, **Al³⁺** contributes stronger cross-linking (more stable polysalt network), improving final properties.\n  - ▫️ Over the next **~24 hours**: **Ca²⁺ is replaced by Al³⁺** (maturation/strengthening).\n  - ▫️ Further slow maturation: even after the first day, the material continues to mature, improving its translucency and resistance to acid attack and desiccation (drying out).\n  - ▫️ **Na⁺** and **F⁻** do not participate in cross-linking:\n    - ○ Some Na⁺ may replace H⁺ on carboxyl groups.\n    - ○ F⁻ disperses within the matrix phase and remains available for release.\n  - ▫️ The cross-linked phase becomes hydrated over time as it matures.\n  - ▫️ The undissolved glass particles become sheathed by a silica-rich gel layer formed on their surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Final set microstructure (what the set cement “is”)\n\n- ● A set GIC consists of:\n  - ▫️ Undissolved glass particles\n    - ○ Coated with **silica gel**\n  - ▫️ Embedded in an amorphous matrix of:\n    - ○ Hydrated **calcium** and **aluminum polysalts**\n    - ○ Containing **fluoride**\n\n- ● **GIC Setting Reaction + Final Set Microstructure:**\n\n![Set GIC Microstructure](/assets/set_gic_microstructure_new.png)\n\n---\n\n## 9) Mechanism of adhesion to tooth (IMP)\n\n- ● GIC bonds to tooth mainly by **chemical interaction**, not just “sticking.”\n\n### A) Surface conditioning prepares the tooth\n\n- ● A mild **polyacrylic acid conditioner**:\n  - ▫️ Removes/cleans smear layer surface.\n  - ▫️ Increases surface energy and wettability.\n  - ▫️ Improves chemical bonding.\n\n- ● Example commonly taught: **~10% polyacrylic acid for ~10 seconds** (product protocols vary).\n\n### B) What bonds to what?\n\n- ● Carboxylate groups (**–COO⁻**) from the cement interact with **calcium ions** in hydroxyapatite (enamel/dentin).\n  - ▫️ Commonly described as **chelation / ionic bonding**.\n\n### C) Early stage assistance: wetting + hydrogen bonding (why “glossy” matters clinically)\n\n- ● Freshly mixed GIC has available carboxyl groups and water; rapid intimate contact supports early adhesion phenomena (including hydrogen bonding interactions described in maturation literature) before the more stable ionic exchange develops.\n\n- ● Key exam line you can safely use:\n  - ▫️ “GIC bonds to teeth by ion exchange/chelation between polyacid carboxyl groups and tooth calcium, with development of an ion-rich interfacial layer.”\n\n- ● Cavity illustration is not accurate—just to give an idea.\n\n- ● **GIC Chemical Adhesion to Tooth (–COO⁻ chelation to Ca²⁺):**\n\n![Chemical Adhesion](/assets/c_early_stage_assistance_wetting_hydrogen_bonding_why_glossy_matters_clinically_1.png)\n\n---\n\n## 10) Clinical manipulation (cementing + restorative): the “do it right or it fails” section\n\n### A) Conditions required for cementing fixed prostheses (8.1)\n\n- ● For luting, these must be satisfied:\n  - ▫️ Prepared tooth surface must be clean and blotted dry.\n  - ▫️ Entire intaglio surface must be coated with luting cement and seated completely.\n  - ▫️ Excess cement must be removed at the appropriate time.\n\n### B) Surface preparation (conditioning) — details + purpose (8.2) (IMP)\n\n- ● Goal: sustained adhesion requires a properly prepared tooth surface.\n\n- ● Options described:\n  - ▫️ Clean with pumice slurry to remove smear layer.\n  - ▫️ OR condition/etch with:\n    - ○ **Phosphoric acid 34–37%**, or\n    - ○ **Polyacrylic acid 10–20%**\n\n- ● Typical time:\n  - ▫️ **10–20 seconds** conditioning.\n  - ▫️ Then **20–30 seconds** water rinse.\n\n- ● Drying:\n  - ▫️ Surface should be dried but not desiccated.\n  - ▫️ Must remain uncontaminated by saliva/blood.\n\n- ● If residual dentin thickness is **< 0.5 mm**:\n  - ▫️ Use a **calcium hydroxide liner** (**Ca(OH)₂**).\n\n- ● “Surface conditioning” (IMP):\n  - ▫️ Introduced by **McLean and Wilson (1977)** and termed surface conditioning.\n  - ▫️ Purpose: mainly remove smear layer so GIC bonds to dentin, not the smear layer; improves wetting, promotes ion exchange, increases surface energy.\n  - ▫️ Polyacrylic acid options mentioned:\n    - ○ **10%**, **25%**, or **40%** solutions (examples given).\n    - ○ Often recommended: passive **10 seconds** of **10%**, or **10–15 seconds** of **10–25%**.\n  - ▫️ Other acids listed:\n    - ○ **10% citric acid**\n    - ○ **3% hydrogen peroxide**\n    - ○ **25% tannic acid**\n    - ○ **10% EDTA**\n\n### C) Material preparation (mixing rules that control bonding) (8.3) (can skip)\n\n- ● Follow the manufacturer’s **P/L ratio**.\n\n- ● Mixing surface:\n  - ▫️ Paper pad or cool, dry glass slab (retards reaction, extends working time).\n  - ▫️ Slab should not be colder than the dew point.\n\n- ● Dispense just before mixing (to avoid water evaporation → changes acid/water ratio).\n\n- ● Incorporate powder rapidly:\n  - ▫️ Usually half powder first (**5–15 s**), then remaining powder quickly.\n  - ▫️ Mix by folding until a uniform, glossy appearance is achieved.\n\n- ● Mixing time limit: should not exceed **~45 s** (may be less for some products).\n\n- ● **Glossy appearance = critical:**\n  - ▫️ Indicates unreacted polyacid is still present → needed for good bonding.\n\n- ● **Dull appearance = bad sign:**\n  - ▫️ Indicates acid has reacted too much → fewer free carboxyl groups for bonding.\n\n![Placement and Early Protection](/assets/8_4_placement_and_early_protection_moisture_control_imp_1.png)\n\n### D) Placement and early protection (moisture control) (8.4) (IMP)\n\n#### 1) Restorative placement\n\n- ● Cavity should be slightly overfilled.\n\n- ● Freshly mixed GIC is **hygroscopic** (absorbs water).\n\n- ● Immediately after placement, protect surface for **~5 minutes** using a plastic matrix:\n  - ▫️ Prevents gaining/losing water during initial set.\n  - ▫️ Too much water can dilute matrix-forming ions → disrupt hydrated matrix formation.\n\n- ● After matrix removal:\n  - ▫️ Coat surface immediately with varnish supplied with GIC or **petrolatum**.\n\n![Resin Modified GIC](/assets/page_16_1.png)\n\n- ● Finishing:\n  - ▫️ Avoid excessive drying (dehydration → surface damage).\n\n- ● Deck’s “effect of water on cement” (very exam-friendly) (very IMP)\n  - ▫️ Dehydration → fissuring/cracking as water of hydration is lost.\n  - ▫️ Saliva exposure early → surface softening because vital cement-forming ions are lost.\n  - ▫️ Moisture contamination sensitivity:\n    - ○ Some sources suggest up to **24 hours**.\n    - ○ Others recommend protection for **10–30 minutes** after placement.\n\n- ● Failure pattern if not protected:\n  - ▫️ Surface becomes chalky/crazed and more opaque.\n\n- ● **GIC Placement and Early Protection:**\n  \n  \n\n#### 2) Luting placement\n\n- ● Apply by plastic instrument to prosthesis.\n\n- ● Excess cement can be removed:\n  - ▫️ Immediately upon seating, or\n  - ▫️ After the time stated by manufacturer.\n\n- ● No matrix needed for initial set.\n\n- ● After complete removal of excess:\n  - ▫️ Coat margins with varnish to allow proper maturation.\n\n---\n\n## 11) Fluoride release (what happens after setting)\n\n- ● After setting, GIC releases fluoride in amounts comparable to silicate cement.\n\n- ● In vitro studies show potential inhibition of enamel/dentin demineralization.\n\n- ● Not all clinical studies confirm prevention of secondary caries vs other materials (e.g., composites).\n\n---\n\n## 12) Biological and mechanical properties (conventional GIC)\n\n### A) Biocompatibility\n\n- ● Pulpal response to GIC is favorable and generally mild.\n\n- ● Reasons for mild response:\n  - ▫️ High buffering capacity of hydroxyapatite.\n  - ▫️ Large molecular weight of polyacrylic acid prevents it from entering dentinal tubules.\n\n- ● Comparative pulp reaction: **ZOE < Glass Ionomer < Zinc Phosphate**.\n\n- ● Acidity: the powder-to-liquid ratio influences the acidity of the material.\n\n- ● Deep cavities: manufacturers recommend using a **Ca(OH)₂** liner when the restoration is within **0.5 mm** of the dental pulp.\n\n### B) Solubility & disintegration\n\n- ● Initial solubility: high due to the leaching of intermediate products.\n\n- ● Setting time: the complete setting reaction takes **24 hours**.\n\n- ● Protection: cement should be protected from saliva during this initial **24-hour** period.\n\n### C) Anticariogenic properties\n\n- ● Fluoride is released from the matrix at the time of mixing.\n\n- ● Physical integrity: fluoride can be released without affecting the physical properties of the cement.\n\n- ● Release pattern:\n  - ▫️ Initial release is high but declines after **3 months**.\n  - ▫️ Following this decline, fluoride release continues for a long period.\n\n- ● Fluoride reservoir: GIC can take up fluoride during topical fluoride treatments and release it again, acting as a “fluoride reservoir”.\n\n### D) Strength, stiffness, and toughness\n\n- ● Key comparisons:\n  - ▫️ Compressive strength: similar to **zinc phosphate**.\n  - ▫️ Diametral tensile: slightly higher than zinc phosphate.\n  - ▫️ Modulus of elasticity: about half that of zinc phosphate → GIC is less stiff, more elastic deformation.\n  - ▫️ Because it is less stiff, GIC is less desirable than zinc phosphate to support an all-ceramic crown (greater tensile stress may develop in the crown under load).\n\n- ● Fracture toughness (as listed):\n\n| Material | Fracture toughness (Avg) |\n|---|---:|\n| Hybrid Composite | **~1.84** |\n| Hybrid GIC (Restoration) | **1.37** |\n| Resin Cement | **1.30** |\n| Amalgam | **~1.29** |\n| Compomer | **~1.10** |\n| Hybrid GIC (Luting) | **~0.94** |\n| Conventional GIC (Restoration) | **0.72** |\n| High-Viscosity GIC | **~0.59** |\n| Metal-Reinforced GIC (Cermet) | **0.51** |\n| Conventional GIC (Luting) | **~0.32** |\n| Metal-Reinforced GIC (Admixture) | **0.30** |\n\n- ● Hybrid GIC is the strongest GIC (as noted).\n\n### E) Wear\n\n- ● Restorative GICs are more vulnerable to wear than composites in toothbrush abrasion and simulated occlusal wear tests.\n\n---\n\n## 13) “Related cement” Zinc polycarboxylate cement (keep separate so you don’t mix it with GIC)\n\n- ● Added as it has the same chemical bond.\n\n### A) Working time and viscosity (figure description in text)\n\n- ● Working time:\n  - ▫️ Polycarboxylate ≈ **2.5 min**\n  - ▫️ Zinc phosphate ≈ **5 min**\n\n- ● Relative viscosities as they set:\n  - ▫️ Zinc phosphate is initially more viscous but longer seating time compared with polycarboxylate and GIC.\n\n### B) Excess cement removal (polycarboxylate)\n\n- ● Polycarboxylate passes through a rubbery stage.\n\n- ● Do not remove excess during rubbery stage:\n  - ▫️ You may pull cement from margins → voids.\n\n- ● Remove excess:\n  - ▫️ Immediately after cementing, or\n  - ▫️ After it becomes hard.\n  - ▫️ (If removing later, coat prosthesis outer surface with a separating medium.)\n\n### C) Control of working time (polycarboxylate)\n\n- ● Cool slab lengthens working time but can thicken polyacrylic acid (hinders mixing).\n\n- ● Refrigerating powder is useful: retards reaction without raising liquid viscosity.\n\n- ● Polycarboxylate is more viscous than similar GIC mix but becomes thinner at high shear:\n  - ▫️ Clinically: rapid spatulation + fast seating lowers viscosity for complete seating.\n\n### D) Mechanical/biological snapshot (polycarboxylate)\n\n- ● Compressive strength (lower than zinc phosphate).\n\n- ● More elastic than zinc phosphate → harder to remove after setting.\n\n- ● Acids dissolve it; low P/L ratio increases solubility.\n\n### E) Why polycarboxylate is mentioned (and why GIC uses similar chemistry)\n\n- ● Polycarboxylate cement is important because it was one of the first cements to show true chemical adhesion to tooth.\n\n- ● What gives polycarboxylate its adhesion?\n  - ▫️ Liquid is polyacrylic acid; carboxyl groups chelate calcium in enamel/dentin → chemical bond.\n\n- ● Why is that relevant to GIC?\n  - ▫️ GIC also relies on polyacrylic acid carboxyl groups for bonding to tooth calcium—same core adhesion chemistry idea, but with a different powder system (ion-leachable glass) and additional benefits like fluoride release.\n\n---\n\n## 14) Metal-reinforced glass ionomer cements (why they exist + what they actually do)\n\n### A) What is added\n\n- ● Metallic fillers to improve stress-bearing capacity:\n  - ▫️ Alloy admixture: silver alloy powder particles mixed in → grayish, radiopaque.\n  - ▫️ Cermet: silver sintered to glass particles → grayish, radiopaque.\n\n- ● Same concerns/procedures as conventional GIC apply.\n\n### B) Fluoride release differences (as described)\n\n- ● Release decreases over time.\n\n- ● Cermet releases less fluoride because some glass is metal-coated.\n\n- ● Alloy admixture releases more because metal is not bonded to glass → more exposed glass surface for leaching.\n\n### C) Where they are useful\n\n- ● Core buildups for cast crowns.\n\n- ● Restoratives on occlusal surfaces of primary molars.\n\n- ● Benefit: adhesion + fluoride release.\n\n### D) Limitations (must-know)\n\n- ● Limited as an alternative to amalgam/composite for posterior restorations.\n\n- ● In vitro: weaker than resin composite cores → do not use if cement is **> 40%** of total core buildup; use pins/retention forms if needed.\n\n- ● Metallic fillers do not significantly improve fracture toughness compared with other restorative glass ionomers.\n\n- ● No improvement in clinical performance/life expectancy for Class II in deciduous teeth vs conventional GIC.\n\n- ● Practical advantage: harden rapidly → can finish sooner (useful in pedodontics).\n\n---\n\n## 15) High-viscosity GIC and ART (atraumatic restorative treatment)\n\n### A) What ART is (concept)\n\n- ● Developed for regions without electricity/water infrastructure.\n\n- ● Uses hand instruments for:\n  - ▫️ Opening cavity.\n  - ▫️ Removing carious dentin.\n  - ▫️ Mixing material.\n\n- ● GIC is the “natural choice” because:\n  - ▫️ Releases fluoride.\n  - ▫️ Bonds chemically to tooth structure.\n  - ▫️ Helpful when complete caries removal is difficult due to limited facilities.\n\n### B) Why “high-viscosity” versions were developed\n\n- ● Smaller glass particle sizes + higher P/L ratio.\n\n- ● Higher compressive strength.\n\n- ● Excellent packability/handling.\n\n- ● Encapsulated packaging increases consistency and acceptance.\n\n### C) ART clinical steps (as listed)\n\n- ● Steps:\n  - ▫️ 1.

others show no resin infiltration into etched dentin.\n\n- ● Higher bond strengths to teeth/composites reported vs conventional GIC, likely due to micromechanical interlocking to roughened surface.\n\n### E) Drawbacks you must not forget\n\n- ● Resin polymerization causes more shrinkage than conventional GIC → can increase microleakage.\n\n- ● Lower water and carboxylic acid contents reduce wetting → more microleakage than conventional GIC.\n\n- ● **HEMA** release can cause pulpal inflammation and allergic contact dermatitis → less biocompatible than conventional GIC.\n\n- ● Temperature rise during polymerization is another drawback.\n\n### F) Liner/base role and “sandwich technique”\n\n- ● Hybrid ionomer base/liner acts as intermediate bonding layer under composite:\n  - ▫️ Adhesion to dentin reduces gap formation at gingival margins in dentin/cementum.\n  - ▫️ Helps compensate for composite polymerization shrinkage.\n  - ▫️ Reduces technique sensitivity.\n  - ▫️ Provides fluoride anticariogenic effect.\n\n- ● Recommended for Class II and V composite restorations in moderate/high caries risk.\n\n### G) For Class V (cervical) restorations + Root caries (RMGIC preferred)\n\n- ● Bonds well to dentin/cementum (ionic/chemical bond) → Class V margins often on root surface, where composite bond is more technique-sensitive.\n\n- ● More forgiving in moisture control → cervical area hard to isolate; slight moisture contamination hurts composite bonding more.\n\n- ● Low polymerization-shrinkage stress compared with composites → less chance of marginal gap at gingival margin.\n\n- ● Fluoride release → helpful because Class V areas often have higher caries risk (especially root caries).\n\n- ● Thermal expansion closer to tooth + elastic “stress absorption” → cervical region flexes (abfraction); RMGIC tolerates stress and mismatch better than brittle materials.\n\n- ● Good marginal seal on root + less post-op sensitivity than many alternatives in real clinical conditions.\n\n- ● Compared to conventional GIC:\n  - ▫️ ✅ Higher fracture toughness, better tolerates moisture, and has lower wear.\n\n- ● That’s why it’s a go-to for Class V cervical lesions, especially when the gingival margin is on dentin/cementum and isolation is difficult.\n\n### H) Compared with conventional GIC, RMGIC generally\n\n- ● ✅ Tolerates moisture better (early set) — resin polymerization gives an early “set” and reduces the extreme early water sensitivity.\n\n- ● ✅ Has higher fracture toughness / flexural strength — resin network improves crack resistance and toughness.\n\n- ● ✅ Shows better wear resistance than conventional GIC in many clinical situations (though it still usually wears more than composites).\n\n### I) Water uptake and expansion (high-yield)\n\n- ● **HEMA** increases water absorption → expansion up to **~8% by volume**.\n\n- ● Linked to fracture of all-ceramic crowns in some contexts (core buildup or luting).\n\n---\n\n## 17) Calcium Aluminate Glass Ionomer Cements (hybrid calcium aluminate + GIC)\n\n### A) What it is\n\n- ● Hybrid material designed for luting fixed prostheses, between calcium aluminate cement and GIC.\n\n### B) Calcium aluminate component (hydraulic cement behavior)\n\n- ● Made by sintering high-purity **Al₂O₃ + CaO** (**~1:1 molar ratio**) → monocalcium aluminate.\n\n- ● When mixed with water:\n  - ▫️ Dissolves **Ca²⁺**, **Al(OH)₄⁻**, **OH⁻**.\n  - ▫️ Weak acid-base reaction begins (powder base, water weak acid).\n  - ▫️ At low water-to-cement ratios: immediate precipitation of hydrates → growth/hardening over time.\n\n### C) Hybrid calcium aluminate GIC ingredients\n\n- ● Powder includes:\n  - ▫️ Calcium aluminate.\n  - ▫️ Polyacrylic acid.\n  - ▫️ Tartaric acid.\n  - ▫️ Strontium-fluoro-alumino-glass.\n  - ▫️ Strontium fluoride.\n\n- ● Liquid:\n  - ▫️ **~99.6% water + 0.4% additives** controlling setting.\n\n### D) What each part contributes\n\n- ● Glass ionomer components: early properties (viscosity, setting time, strength).\n\n- ● Calcium aluminate: basic pH during curing, reduced microleakage, excellent biocompatibility, long-term stability/strength.\n\n- ● Polyacrylic acid dual function:\n  - ▫️ Cross-linked by Ca²⁺ from both glass and calcium aluminate.\n  - ▫️ Dispersing agent for calcium aluminate.\n\n- ● Final material: composite of hydrated ceramic + cross-linked polyacrylate polymer.\n\n- ● Packaged in capsules for mechanical mixing.\n\n### E) Reported handling/film thickness/expansion\n\n- ● Surface hydroxyapatite formation in phosphate buffer reported.\n\n---\n\n## 18) Compomer (polyacid-modified composite)\n\n### A) Definition (what it is trying to combine)\n\n- ● Polyacid-modified composite made by incorporating GIC glass particles into a water-free polyacid liquid monomer with an initiator.\n\n- ● Rationale: combine fluoride release of GIC with durability of resin composite.\n\n- ● Properties are distinct from both composites and glass ionomers.\n\n### B) Chemistry and setting\n\n- ● Usually a one-paste, light-cure restorative (also powder-liquid systems for luting exist).\n\n- ● Water-free materials contain:\n  - ▫️ 1. Nonreactive inorganic fillers.\n  - ▫️ 2. Reactive silicate glass particles.\n  - ▫️ 3. Sodium fluoride.\n  - ▫️ 4. Polyacid-modified monomers + photoactivators.\n\n- ● Setting:\n  - ▫️ Photopolymerization of acidic monomer starts the set.\n  - ▫️ Intraoral water uptake starts a slow acid-base reaction → fluoride release.\n\n- ● Moisture-sensitive → packaged to prevent moisture absorption.\n\n### C) Bonding mechanism\n\n- ● Restorative compomers need a dentin-bonding agent prior to placement (they lack water, so they are not self-adhesive like GIC/hybrid ionomer).\n\n- ● Powder-liquid compomer luting systems can be self-adhesive because water in liquid makes mix acidic (like hybrid ionomers).\n\n### D) Clinical manipulation / uses\n\n- ● Mainly in low-stress areas (Class III and V) or as alternative to GIC/composite.\n\n- ● Tooth should be etched before bonding agent + compomer.\n\n- ● Finished like resin composites.\n\n### E) Water uptake effects (important)\n\n- ● Water absorption up to **~3.5% by weight** helps complete acid-base reaction and fluoride release.\n\n- ● Compomers release less fluoride than conventional GICs and hybrid ionomers.\n\n- ● Strength changes on storage:\n  - ▫️ Compressive/flexural strength can decrease in saline (linked to water uptake + acid-base reaction).\n  - ▫️ Surface hardness and microtensile strength may be unchanged.\n\n- ● Silane-treated reactive glass reduces water uptake and increases strength.\n\n### F) Clinical performance notes\n\n- ● Not all compomers perform acceptably in Class V; color stability can be problematic (refractive index changes + staining).\n\n- ● 24-month study: similar to composite sealants except marginal integrity.\n\n- ● Performs as well as resin composites for Class I & II restorations and acceptable for orthodontic band luting.\n\n---\n\n## 19) Resin cements\n\n- ● Resin cements polymerize by:\n  - ▫️ Chemical cure.\n  - ▫️ Light cure.\n  - ▫️ Dual cure (majority today).\n\n- ● Light-cure resin cement used for cementing porcelain veneers due to polymerization concerns under thick prostheses.\n\n- ● Some systems aim to eliminate etch/prime/bond steps using acidic side-chain monomers (e.g., phosphoric acid groups) that bond to calcium → “self-adhesive resin cement.”\n\n- ● Clinical manipulation:\n  - ▫️ Monomer component is irritating to pulp.\n  - ▫️ If remaining dentin **< 0.5 mm** → liner protection is important.\n  - ▫️ Chemically cured resin cements: mixed **20–30 s**; slow activation gives extended working time; strength increases as cure completes.\n  - ▫️ Gel stage can appear around **90 s** after mixing in some systems; excess removal at gel stage is typical (as described).\n\n---\n\n## 20) CRITICAL QUESTIONS\n\n### A) Q1) Water plays two critical roles in the setting of conventional GIC. What are they and how do they work?\n\n- ● Answer:\n  - ▫️ **1) Reaction medium:** water allows the acid to attack glass and ions (**Ca²⁺/Al³⁺/etc.**) to dissolve, move, and react so the polysalt matrix can form.\n  - ▫️ **2) Hydration/maturation:** the cross-linked matrix becomes hydrated over time as the cement matures; losing this water (dehydration) can cause cracking/crazing, while early contamination can wash out cement-forming ions and soften the surface.\n\n### B) Q2) Under what condition might zinc phosphate cement be preferred over GIC for luting of ceramic crowns?\n\n- ● Answer:\n  - ▫️ When higher stiffness/support is needed: GIC has about half the modulus of zinc phosphate, so it is less stiff and can allow more elastic deformation.\n  - ▫️ Under occlusal load this can increase tensile stresses in an all-ceramic crown; therefore zinc phosphate may be preferred for better rigid support.\n\n### C) Q3) For ART, why is a high-viscosity GIC the most appropriate material?\n\n- ● Answer:\n  - ▫️ Because ART relies on hand instruments and minimal infrastructure, the ideal material must be:\n    - ○ Chemically adhesive to tooth structure.\n    - ○ Fluoride releasing (anticariogenic support).\n    - ○ Workable in hand-mixed/field conditions.\n  - ▫️ High-viscosity GICs also have improved packability and higher strength due to smaller particle sizes and higher P/L ratio.\n\n### D) Q4) What are the advantages of incorporating polymerizing resin in GICs (resin-modified/hybrid ionomers)?\n\n- ● Answer:\n  - ▫️ Enables chemical/light/dual cure, improving early set control.\n  - ▫️ Can improve early strength, extend working time (especially with some formulations), and increase translucency.\n  - ▫️ Often shows higher tensile strength and improved bonding/interlocking on conditioned surfaces.\n  - ▫️ But must be balanced against:\n    - ○ Polymerization shrinkage.\n    - ○ Increased microleakage risk.\n    - ○ Water uptake/expansion.\n    - ○ HEMA biocompatibility concerns.\n\n### E) Q5) How does the compomer differ from resin-based composite?\n\n- ● Answer:\n  - ▫️ Compomer is a polyacid-modified composite: includes reactive GIC glass and polyacid-modified monomers.\n  - ▫️ Sets first by photopolymerization, then undergoes a slow acid-base reaction after water uptake, leading to fluoride release.\n  - ▫️ Restorative compomers require a dentin bonding agent (not self-adhesive like conventional GIC).\n\n### F) Q6) What is the setting mechanism of calcium aluminate GIC?\n\n- ● Answer:\n  - ▫️ Calcium aluminate part behaves like a hydraulic cement: dissolves ions in water, then hydrates precipitate and harden over time.\n  - ▫️ Simultaneously, the GIC portion undergoes the typical acid-base reaction, with polyacrylic acid cross-linking by Ca²⁺ ions leached from both the glass and calcium aluminate, producing a composite of hydrated ceramic + cross-linked polyacrylate polymer.\n  ",keyPoints:["Composition: Fluoroaluminosilicate glass + Polyacrylic acid (Al:Si ratio critical).","Setting: Acid-base reaction.
