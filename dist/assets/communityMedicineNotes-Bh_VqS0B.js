<h3>2) CORE DEFINITIONS (Exam Wording)</h3>

<h4>Epidemiology</h4>

- Definition 1: Study of distribution and determinants of health-related states in specified populations
- Definition 2: Application of this study to control health problems
- Key term: 'Distribution' = Person, Place, Time patterns
- Key term: 'Determinants' = Factors that influence health outcomes

<h4>Epidemiologic Triad</h4>

- Classic model explaining disease occurrence through interaction of three components
- Agent = Factor whose presence causes disease (bacteria, virus, chemical)
- Host = Person or population susceptible to disease
- Environment = External conditions that allow disease transmission

<h3>3) CONCEPT BUILD</h3>

<h4>Aims of Epidemiology</h4>

- 1. DESCRIBE disease distribution: Who (person), Where (place), When (time)
- Dental Example: Caries more common in lower SES children (person), urban areas (place), after sugar exposure (time)
- 2. EXPLAIN disease etiology: Identify causes and risk factors
- Dental Example: Streptococcus mutans + sucrose = caries initiation
- 3. PREDICT disease occurrence: Estimate future cases for planning
- Dental Example: Projecting oral cancer cases based on tobacco use trends
- 4. CONTROL disease: Develop and evaluate prevention strategies
- Dental Example: Water fluoridation reduces caries by 40-60%

<h4>Epidemiologic Triad - Dental Examples</h4>

- DENTAL CARIES:
- Agent: Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus
- Host: Tooth morphology, saliva flow, immune status
- Environment: Diet (sugar frequency), fluoride exposure, oral hygiene

- PERIODONTAL DISEASE:
- Agent: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
- Host: Genetic susceptibility, diabetes, immune response
- Environment: Smoking, stress, oral hygiene practices

- ORAL CANCER:
- Agent: Tobacco carcinogens, HPV (types 16, 18)
- Host: Genetic predisposition, nutritional status (iron deficiency)
- Environment: Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, betel nut chewing

</div>
<h3>4) MEASUREMENTS IN EPIDEMIOLOGY</h3>

<h4>Rates, Ratios, Proportions</h4>

- RATE: Measures occurrence of event in population over time
- Formula: (Number of events / Population at risk) x Time multiplier
- Example: Caries incidence = 2 new lesions per 100 children per year

- RATIO: Comparison of two quantities (numerator not in denominator)
- Formula: A / B (no time component)
- Example: Dentist-to-population ratio = 1:5000

- PROPORTION: Numerator is subset of denominator (no time)
- Formula: (Part / Whole) x 100
- Example: 60% of adults have periodontal disease

<h4>Incidence</h4>

- CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE (CI): Proportion developing disease over time period
- Formula: CI = New cases / Population at risk at start
- Example: 10 new caries cases among 100 children over 1 year = 10%

- INCIDENCE RATE (IR): Rate per person-time of observation
- Formula: IR = New cases / Total person-time at risk
- Example: 5 cases per 1000 person-years

- INTERPRETATION:
- High incidence = Active disease transmission/risk
- Low incidence = Effective prevention/control measures working

<h4>Prevalence</h4>

- POINT PREVALENCE: Proportion with disease at specific point in time
- Formula: Cases at time T / Population at time T
- Example: 30% of schoolchildren have dental caries on Jan 1, 2024

- PERIOD PREVALENCE: Proportion with disease during a time period
- Formula: Cases during period / Average population during period
- Example: 45% of adults visited dentist in past 12 months

- INTERPRETATION:
- High prevalence = Large disease burden (plan services)
- Low prevalence = Disease well-controlled or short duration

<h4>Relationship: Incidence vs Prevalence</h4>

- Prevalence = Incidence x Average Duration of disease

- Factors INCREASING Prevalence:
- - Longer disease duration (chronic conditions)
- - Improved treatment (people live longer with disease)
- - Increased incidence

- Factors DECREASING Prevalence:
- - Shorter disease duration (effective cure)
- - Decreased incidence
- - High mortality from disease

<h4>Relative Risk (RR)</h4>

- DEFINITION: Ratio of disease incidence in exposed vs unexposed groups
- FORMULA: RR = Incidence in exposed / Incidence in unexposed = (a/a+b) / (c/c+d)

- INTERPRETATION:
- RR = 1: No association between exposure and disease
- RR > 1: Increased risk (positive association)
- RR < 1: Decreased risk (protective factor)

- DENTAL EXAMPLE:
- Smokers: 30% periodontal disease
- Non-smokers: 10% periodontal disease
- RR = 30/10 = 3.0 (Smokers have 3x higher risk)

- WHEN USED: Cohort studies (prospective/retrospective)

<h4>Odds Ratio (OR)</h4>

- DEFINITION: Ratio of odds of exposure in cases vs controls
- FORMULA: OR = (a x d) / (b x c) where a=exposed cases, b=exposed controls, etc.

- INTERPRETATION:
- OR = 1: No association
- OR > 1: Exposure increases odds of disease
- OR < 1: Exposure decreases odds of disease (protective)

- DENTAL EXAMPLE (Case-Control):
- Oral cancer cases: 80 smokers, 20 non-smokers
- Controls: 40 smokers, 60 non-smokers
- OR = (80 x 60) / (20 x 40) = 4800/800 = 6.0
- Interpretation: Smokers have 6x higher odds of oral cancer

- WHEN USED: Case-control studies (when incidence cannot be calculated)

<h4>Attributable Risk (AR)</h4>

- DEFINITION: Excess incidence in exposed group attributable to exposure
- FORMULA: AR = Incidence exposed - Incidence unexposed

- POPULATION ATTRIBUTABLE RISK (PAR):
- Excess incidence in total population due to exposure
- PAR = Incidence total - Incidence unexposed

- USE: Public health planning - how much disease can be prevented
- DENTAL EXAMPLE: If smoking cessation reduces periodontal disease by AR amount

<h4>Bias vs Confounding</h4>

- BIAS: Systematic error in study design/conduct leading to wrong results
- Types: Selection bias, Information bias (recall, observer), Publication bias
- DENTAL EXAMPLE: Recall bias - caries patients may recall sugar intake differently

- CONFOUNDING: Distortion of exposure-disease relationship by third variable
- Confounder associated with BOTH exposure AND disease
- DENTAL EXAMPLE: Socioeconomic status confounds sugar-caries relationship
- Control methods: Randomization, Restriction, Matching, Stratification

<h3>5) EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY DESIGNS</h3>

<h4>Descriptive Epidemiology</h4>

- PURPOSE: Describe disease patterns by Person, Place, Time
- PERSON: Age, sex, race, occupation, socioeconomic status
- PLACE: Geographic variation, urban-rural differences
- TIME: Secular trends, seasonal patterns, cyclic changes

- DENTAL EXAMPLES:
- Person: Caries higher in children, periodontal disease higher in adults
- Place: Fluorosis endemic in high-fluoride areas
- Time: Seasonal variation in dental trauma (summer sports)

<h4>Analytical Epidemiology - Case-Control Study</h4>

- DIRECTION: Retrospective (outcome -> exposure)
- MEASURE: Odds Ratio (OR)

- STRENGTHS:
- - Good for rare diseases
- - Relatively quick and inexpensive
- - Can study multiple exposures

- LIMITATIONS:
- - Cannot calculate incidence/risk directly
- - Recall bias (cases may remember exposures differently)
- - Temporal ambiguity (did exposure precede disease?)

- DENTAL EXAMPLE: Oral cancer cases vs controls, assess tobacco/alcohol history

<h4>Analytical Epidemiology - Cohort Study</h4>

- DESIGN: Start with exposure, follow forward for outcome
- DIRECTION: Prospective (exposure -> outcome) or Retrospective
- MEASURE: Relative Risk (RR), Attributable Risk (AR)

- STRENGTHS:
- - Can calculate incidence and risk directly
- - Clear temporal sequence
- - Good for multiple outcomes from one exposure

- LIMITATIONS:
- - Expensive and time-consuming
- - Loss to follow-up
- - Not suitable for rare diseases

- DENTAL EXAMPLE: Follow smokers vs non-smokers for 10 years, measure periodontal disease

<h4>Experimental Epidemiology</h4>

- RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT):
- - Gold standard for intervention evaluation
- - Random allocation to treatment/control groups
- - Double-blinding: Neither participant nor investigator knows allocation
- - Allocation concealment: Randomization sequence hidden until assignment

- FIELD TRIAL: Intervention in healthy individuals (primary prevention)
- DENTAL EXAMPLE: Fluoride varnish application to prevent caries

- COMMUNITY TRIAL: Intervention at community level
- DENTAL EXAMPLE: Water fluoridation in entire community

<h3>6) INVESTIGATION OF AN EPIDEMIC</h3>

<h4>Steps in Epidemic Investigation (Flowchart)</h4>

- Rule out artificial increase (improved reporting, diagnostic change)

- STEP 2: CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS
- Clinical examination, laboratory confirmation
- Ensure case definition is consistent

- STEP 3: DEFINE CASE AND COUNT CASES
- Establish case definition (clinical + lab + epidemiologic criteria)
- Active case finding in community

- STEP 4: ORIENT DATA (Person, Place, Time)
- Who is affected? Where? When did it start?

- STEP 5: CONSTRUCT EPIDEMIC CURVE
- Histogram: Cases vs Time of onset
- Shape suggests mode of transmission

- STEP 6: FORMULATE AND TEST HYPOTHESIS
- Common source vs propagated epidemic
- Analytic studies to test hypotheses

- STEP 7: IMPLEMENT CONTROL MEASURES

<h4>Epidemic Curve Interpretation</h4>

- COMMON SOURCE (Point Source):
- Shape: Sharp upward slope, single peak, gradual decline
- Example: Foodborne outbreak from contaminated food at single event

- COMMON SOURCE (Continuous):
- Shape: Plateau instead of peak
- Example: Water supply contamination over weeks

- PROPAGATED (Person-to-Person):
- Shape: Series of progressively taller peaks (waves)
- Example: Influenza, measles transmission
- Incubation period visible between peaks

- RESERVOIR: Where agent lives and multiplies
- Dental examples: Patient's blood/saliva, contaminated instruments

- PORTAL OF EXIT: How agent leaves reservoir
- Dental examples: Blood, saliva, respiratory droplets

- MODE OF TRANSMISSION: How agent spreads
- Contact: Direct (patient to staff) or Indirect (contaminated surfaces)
- Droplet: Coughing, sneezing, talking (within 1 meter)
- Airborne: Small particles that remain suspended (TB, measles, chickenpox)

- PORTAL OF ENTRY: How agent enters new host
- Dental examples: Needlestick injuries, mucous membrane exposure, inhalation

- SUSCEPTIBLE HOST: Person at risk of infection
- Factors: Immune status, vaccination, age, underlying disease

<h3>3) STANDARD PRECAUTIONS</h3>

- DEFINITION: Minimum infection control practices for ALL patients, ALL procedures
- Rationale: Treat all blood and body fluids as potentially infectious

- COMPONENTS:
- 1. HAND HYGIENE: Most important infection control measure
- - When: Before/after patient contact, before aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure
- - Methods: Soap and water (20 seconds) or Alcohol-based hand rub (20-30 seconds)
- - Use soap and water when hands visibly soiled or after restroom

- 2. SHARPS SAFETY:
- - Never recap needles using both hands
- - Use safety-engineered devices
- - Dispose immediately in puncture-resistant sharps container
- - Fill container only 2/3 full

- 3. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE):

- - Target: Established disease
- - Dental Examples: Restorations, RCT, extractions, prosthetics

<h3>2) PLAQUE CONTROL</h3>

<h4>Mechanical Plaque Control</h4>

- TOOTHBRUSHING:
- - Most common and effective mechanical method
- - Bass method: Bristles at 45-degree angle to gingiva, vibrate
- - Modified Bass: Add sweeping motion occlusally
- - Frequency: Twice daily for 2 minutes
- - Brush replacement: Every 3 months or when frayed

- INTERDENTAL AIDS:
- - Dental floss: Type based on contact tightness
- - Interdental brushes: For larger spaces, bridges
- - Wooden sticks: Triangular, for posterior areas
- - Oral irrigators: Adjunct, not substitute

<h4>Chemical Plaque Control</h4>

- CHLORHEXIDINE (0.12-0.2%):
- - Gold standard antimicrobial mouthwash
- - Mechanism: Disrupts bacterial cell membrane
- - Side effects: Staining, altered taste, calculus formation
- - Use: Short-term (1-2 weeks), post-surgical

- ESSENTIAL OILS (Listerine):
- - Thymol, eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate
- - Less staining than chlorhexidine
- - Can be used long-term

- OTHER AGENTS:
- - Triclosan: Antimicrobial in toothpaste
- - Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC): Mild antiseptic
- - Fluoride: Primarily anti-caries, mild plaque effect

<h4>Disclosing Agents</h4>

- PURPOSE: Visualize plaque for patient education and self-assessment
- TYPES: Erythrosine (red), fluorescein (fluorescent under UV)
- USE:
- - Apply after rinsing, before brushing
- - Shows areas missed during brushing
- - Useful for teaching proper technique
- - Used in PHP index assessment

<h3>3) CARIES ACTIVITY TESTS</h3>

- DEFINITION: Laboratory/biochemical tests to assess caries risk

- TYPES:
- 1. SNYDER TEST: Measures acid production by salivary bacteria
- - Color change indicates acid production

- 2. ALBANS TEST: Similar to Snyder test

- 3. STRIP MUTANS: Detects S.mutans levels in saliva

- 4. SALIVARY FLOW RATE: Measures unstimulated and stimulated flow
- - Low flow = increased caries risk

- 5. SALIVARY BUFFERING CAPACITY: Ability to neutralize acid

- LIMITATIONS:
- - Not widely used in clinical practice
- - Do not predict caries with high accuracy
- - Expensive and time-consuming

<h3>4) PIT AND FISSURE SEALANTS</h3>

<h4>Definition and Purpose</h4>

- DEFINITION: Material placed in pits and fissures to prevent caries
- PURPOSE: Physical barrier preventing bacterial colonization
- MECHANISM: Seals off retentive areas where toothbrush cannot reach

- - Types: Filled vs Unfilled, Clear vs Tinted
- - Cure: Self-cure or Light-cure

- GLASS IONOMER:
- - Chemical adhesion (no etching needed)
- - Fluoride release
- - Lower retention than resin
- - Use: Moisture control difficult, transitional sealant

<h4>Reasons for Sealant Failure</h4>

- Moisture contamination during placement
- Inadequate etching or rinsing
- Insufficient curing time
- Air bubbles in material
- Occlusal interference
- Saliva contamination before polymerization

<h3>5) CARIES VACCINE</h3>

- CONCEPT: Immunization against S.mutans to prevent colonization

- TARGETS:
- - Antigens: Glucosyltransferase (GTF), Antigen I/II
- - Mechanism: Prevent bacterial adhesion to tooth surface

- CHALLENGES:
- - S.mutans is part of normal flora (ethical concerns)
- - Multiple bacteria involved in caries (not just S.mutans)
- - Need for booster immunizations
- - Cost-effectiveness concerns

- CURRENT STATUS:
- - Research ongoing, no commercial vaccine available
- - Not routine in dental practice

<h3>6) MINIMAL INTERVENTION DENTISTRY (MID)</h3>

<h4>Principles</h4>

- 1. Identify and modify caries risk factors
- 2. Early detection of non-cavitated lesions
- 3. Remineralization of early lesions
- 4. Minimal tissue removal when restoration needed
- 5. Repair rather than replace restorations
- 6. Use of long-lasting restorative materials

<h4>Techniques</h4>

- REMINERALIZATION:
- - Fluoride: Topical applications, high-fluoride toothpaste
- - CPP-ACP (Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate): Recaldent
- - Xylitol: Reduces S.mutans levels

- MINIMAL CAVITY PREPARATION:
- - Air abrasion
- - Chemomechanical caries removal (Carisolv)
- - Lasers

- ADHESIVE RESTORATIONS:
- - Preserve tooth structure
- - Seal margins to prevent microleakage

<h3>7) ATRAUMATIC RESTORATIVE TREATMENT (ART)</h3>

<h4>Concept</h4>

<h3>8) FLUORIDES IN CARIES PREVENTION</h3>

<h4>Natural Occurrence and History</h4>

- Naturally found in water, soil, rocks, some foods
- Optimal water fluoride: 0.7-1.2 ppm (temperature dependent)
- HISTORY:
- - 1901: Frederick McKay observed 'Colorado brown stain'
- - 1931: Fluoride identified as cause
- - 1945: Grand Rapids - first water fluoridation trial
- - Reduction in caries: 40-60%

<h4>Systemic vs Topical Fluoride</h4>

- SYSTEMIC FLUORIDE:
- - Ingested, systemic distribution
- - Benefits: Pre-eruptive (incorporation into developing enamel)
- - Methods: Water fluoridation, dietary supplements
- - Caution: Risk of fluorosis during tooth development

- TOPICAL FLUORIDE:
- - Applied to erupted teeth
- - Benefits: Post-eruptive (surface effects)
- - Methods: Toothpaste, mouthwash, varnish, gel, foam
- - No fluorosis risk (except young children who swallow)

<h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>

- 1. INHIBITION OF DEMINERALIZATION:
- - Fluoride incorporates into enamel, makes it more acid-resistant

- 2. ENHANCEMENT OF REMINERALIZATION:
- - Fluoride attracts calcium and phosphate to repair early lesions

- 3. INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL ENZYMES:
- - Interferes with bacterial acid production

- 4. INCORPORATION INTO ENAMEL (pre-eruptive):
- - Forms fluorapatite (more acid-resistant than hydroxyapatite)

<h4>Fluoride Toxicity</h4>

- ACUTE TOXICITY:
- - Dose: >5 mg/kg body weight (probable toxic dose)
- - Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea
- - Severe: Hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmia, death
- - TREATMENT: Induce vomiting, give calcium (milk, calcium gluconate)

- CHRONIC TOXICITY:
- - Manifestation: Dental fluorosis (enamel hypomineralization)
- - Skeletal fluorosis (very high intake over long period)

- PREVENTION:
- - Supervise children during tooth brushing
- - Pea-sized amount of toothpaste for children <6 years
- - Store fluoride products out of reach of children

<h4>Fluoride Delivery Methods</h4>

- COMMUNITY LEVEL:
- - Water fluoridation (most cost-effective)
- - Salt fluoridation (alternative where water not feasible)
- - Milk fluoridation (school programs)

- PROFESSIONAL APPLICATION:
- - Fluoride varnish (22,600 ppm F): 2-4 times/year
- - Fluoride gel/foam (12,300 ppm F): Tray application
- - Silver diamine fluoride (SDF): Arrests cavitated caries

- SELF-APPLIED:
- - Fluoride toothpaste (1000-1500 ppm F): Twice daily
- - Fluoride mouthwash (225-900 ppm F): Daily/weekly
- - High-fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F): Prescription for high risk
