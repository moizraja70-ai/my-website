**How to answer any neck triangle viva:**

- Boundaries
- Roof
- Floor
- Contents
- Clinical relevance
- One common exam trap

## 1) One-page orientation (anterior vs posterior triangles)

- Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) is the main surface divider:
  - Anterior triangle is in front of SCM.
  - Posterior triangle is behind SCM.
- Anterior triangle subdivisions: submental (Level Ia), submandibular/digastric (Level Ib), carotid, muscular.
- Posterior triangle subdivisions by inferior belly of omohyoid:
  - Occipital triangle (upper)
  - Omoclavicular/supraclavicular triangle (lower)
- Most triangles are paired right and left. The submental triangle is a single midline triangle.

### C) Carotid triangle

![](/assets/triangle-neck/image6.png)

| Item | High-yield facts |
| --- | --- |
| Boundaries | Posterior belly of digastric (superior), superior belly of omohyoid (anteroinferior), anterior border of SCM (posterior) |
| Roof | Skin, superficial fascia/platysma, investing fascia |
| Floor | Thyrohyoid, hyoglossus, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors |
| Carotid sheath relations | Artery medial, IJV lateral, vagus posterior between artery and vein |
| Additional relations | Ansa cervicalis on anterior sheath wall; sympathetic trunk posterior to sheath (not inside) |
| Key contents | Carotid bifurcation, carotid sinus/body, CN XII crossing high, superior laryngeal branches, Level II/III deep nodes |
| Clinical | IJV cannulation and carotid surgery can injure adjacent neurovascular structures |

<div style="background:#e6f4ea;border-left:4px solid #1e8e3e;border-radius:8px;padding:16px 20px;margin:16px 0;">

**Carotid sheath must-write line (MCQ and viva):**

- CCA/ICA medial
- IJV lateral
- Vagus posterior between them
- Sympathetic trunk posterior to sheath, not inside it

### D) Muscular triangle

| Item | High-yield facts |
| --- | --- |
| Boundaries | Midline of neck, anterior border of SCM, superior belly of omohyoid |
| Roof | Skin, superficial fascia/platysma, investing fascia |
| Floor | Strap muscles; deep structures include thyroid, larynx, trachea |
| Contents | Thyroid/parathyroids, laryngeal-tracheal corridor, superior thyroid vessels, ansa cervicalis branches |
| Clinical | Thyroidectomy and tracheostomy corridor |
| Exam trap | Carotid sheath contents are lateral (carotid triangle), not muscular triangle contents |

### E) Posterior triangle (Level V)

![](/assets/triangle-neck/image2.png)
![](/assets/triangle-neck/image14.png)

![](/assets/triangle-neck/image20.png)

| Item | High-yield facts |
| --- | --- |
| Boundaries | Posterior border of SCM, anterior border of trapezius, middle third of clavicle |
| Roof | Skin, superficial fascia, investing fascia |
| Floor | Prevertebral fascia over splenius capitis, levator scapulae, scalenes |
| Contents | CN XI, cutaneous cervical plexus branches at Erb point, EJV, transverse cervical vessels, Level V nodes |
| Clinical | CN XI is vulnerable during posterior triangle node biopsy |
| Deficit pattern | Shoulder droop, weak shrug, impaired abduction above 90 degrees, scapular dyskinesis |

<div style="background:#fce8e6;border-left:4px solid #d93025;border-radius:8px;padding:16px 20px;margin:16px 0;">

**Exam favorite: accessory nerve injury in posterior triangle**

- CN XI runs superficially in this region.
- Injury causes trapezius weakness and shoulder droop.
- Do not confuse this with long thoracic nerve injury.

## 3) Skull base links to neck triangle questions

*Figure 10. Skull base exits and SCM-trapezius orientation that support carotid and posterior triangle viva questions.*

## 4) Named surface and surgical triangles (quick viva add-ons)

- Farabeuf triangle: carotid region localization landmark.
- Lesser supraclavicular fossa: useful landmark for neck vessel access.
- Pirogoff and Beclard triangles: submandibular region landmarks used for lingual artery/hypoglossal localization.

## 5) Rapid recall table

| Triangle | Core boundaries | Core high-yield contents | Most tested nerve/risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Submental (Ia) | Anterior bellies of digastric, hyoid, symphysis | Level Ia nodes, submental veins | Usually nodal pathology focus |
| Submandibular (Ib) | Mandible, anterior and posterior bellies of digastric | Submandibular gland, facial vessels, CN XII, lingual nerve relation | Marginal mandibular, lingual, CN XII |
| Carotid | SCM, posterior belly digastric, superior belly omohyoid | Carotid sheath, bifurcation, sinus/body, CN XII crossing | Vagus/SLN/CN XII and sympathetic chain context |
| Posterior (V) | SCM, trapezius, clavicle | CN XI, EJV, cervical plexus cutaneous branches, Level V nodes | CN XI |

## 6) Common mistakes checklist

<div style="background:#fef7e0;border-left:4px solid #f9ab00;border-radius:8px;padding:16px 20px;margin:16px 0;">

**Avoid these errors in exams:**

- Putting sympathetic trunk inside the carotid sheath
- Mixing up artery-vein-vagus order in the sheath
- Using SCM as posterior border of submandibular triangle
- Confusing CN XI with cervical plexus cutaneous branches at Erb point
- Missing that submental triangle is midline and unpaired
