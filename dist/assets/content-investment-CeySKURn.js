Highly burnishable (malleable). Small, one-surface inlays. Low-stress areas but weak. Rarely used today due to softness. |\n| **Type II** | Medium | 90 – 120 | Moderate strength. Good balance of burnishability and stability. Larger inlays, onlays, 2 or 3 surface restorations. |\n| **Type III** | Hard | 120 – 150 | High strength and durability. The standard for most crown and bridge work. Heat treatable. Full Crowns, Short-span bridges, Abutments. |\n| **Type IV** | Extra Hard | 150+ | Highest strength. Lower gold content, higher Copper/Platinum. Very rigid and resistant to deflection. Removable Partial Denture (RPD) frameworks, Long-span bridges, Clasps and saddles. |\n\n\n\n## B) Composition\n\nTypical:\n\n- **Gypsum binder ~25–35%** (strength + setting expansion).\n\n- **Silica ~65–75%** (controls thermal expansion).\n\n- **Modifiers ~2–3%**: reducing agents/color may be added.\n\n\n\n## C) Big limitation: temperature ceiling\n\n- Gypsum investment must not be heated above **~700°C** because decomposition releases sulfur gases → **shrinkage** + **contamination/tarnish** (sulfides) of alloying elements.\n\n- Many texts also emphasize **carbon-containing gypsum investments** have a lower safe max (often ~650°C).\n\n\n\n## D) Why silica is added (the “expansion science”)\n\nGypsum binder tends to **contract on heating** (after dehydration/phase changes), so silica is used to **counterbalance** that contraction via **silica inversions**.\n\n\n\n### Silica inversion expansions (high-yield temperatures)\n\n- **Cristobalite**: big expansion around **200–270°C** (highest expansion).\n\n- **Quartz**: inversion at **573°C** (significant expansion).\n\n- **Tridymite**: lower expansion overall (less than 1% by 600°C).\n\n\n\n**Why it matters**: you choose silica type/amount to get the “right” mold enlargement at burnout temp.\n\n\n\n## E) Setting Reaction\n\n**Reaction**: Calcium sulfate hemihydrate → Dihydrate (Gypsum crystals)\n\n\n\n**CaSO₄ · ½ H₂O + 1½ H₂O → CaSO₄ · 2 H₂O + Heat**\n\n\n\n- **Mechanism**: This acts as the “glue.” The setting reaction is **exothermic** (releases heat).\n\n- **Structure**: The newly formed **CaSO₄ · 2H₂O** crystals interlock and bridge the silica particles together to form a solid mold.\n\n![Gypsum-Bonded Investment Structure](assets/investment/gypsum_bonded_structure.png)\n\n## F) Expansion types (3 expansions you must separate)\n\n\n\n### 1) Normal (air) setting expansion (LINEAR EXPANSION)\n\n- Happens while setting in air; helps compensate casting shrinkage.\n\n- Typical range ~0.4–0.6%.\n\n\n\n### 2) Hygroscopic setting expansion (Type II concept)\n\n- Setting while in contact with water → much larger (about “~6×” normal).\n\n- Typical allowed range ~1.2–2.2%.\n\n- **Key controls**:\n\n    - ↑ silica content, finer silica → ↑ hygroscopic expansion.\n\n    - α-hemihydrate + silica tends to give more hygroscopic expansion than β.\n\n    - ↑ W/P ratio → ↓ hygroscopic expansion.\n\n    - Less mixing time → ↓ hygroscopic expansion.\n\n    - Older investment (shelf life) → ↓ hygroscopic expansion.\n\n    - Earlier immersion (before initial set) → maximum expansion.\n\n\n\n### 3) Thermal expansion (Type I concept)\n\n- Mainly controlled by type + amount of silica and the W/P ratio.\n\n- Typical target mentioned for gypsum Type I: about ~1.0–1.6%.\n\n- **More water → less thermal expansion** (important clinically).\n\n\n\n## G) Strength (don’t overthink — just know the rules)\n\n- Strength decreases with higher W/P ratio (more water = weaker).\n\n- Heating/cooling cycles can reduce strength (microcracking on cooling is a known issue).\n\n\n\n## H) Porosity of the investment (not casting porosity)\n\n- Porosity is needed so air/gases can escape as molten metal enters.\n\n- Keep the pattern positioned so the end near the ring opening isn’t buried under too much investment (~6 mm as a classic guideline).\n\n\n\n# 6) Phosphate-bonded investments (PBI) — HIGH TEMP WORKHORSE\n\n\n\n![Phosphate-Bonded Investment](assets/investment/investment_img_8_1.png)\n\n\n\nPhosphate-Bonded Investment = “High-Heat / Heavy-Duty” Investment\n\n\n\n### ✅ Used for:\n\n- Metal-ceramic (PFM) alloys (high-fusing).\n\n- Base-metal alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr).\n\n- Can also be used for pressable ceramics (in many systems).\n\n- **BEST investment material mostly used.**\n\n\n\n### ✅ Why not gypsum-bonded here?\n\n- Gypsum-bonded investments must NOT be heated above ~700°C → decomposition + contamination risk.\n\n- Phosphate-bonded investments tolerate much higher burnout/casting temperatures.\n\n\n\n## A) Composition (Simple recipe)\n\n**Powder:**\n\n- **Refractory filler** (mostly silica) = quartz / cristobalite (major portion).\n\n- **Binder system**:\n\n    - MgO (magnesia) = base.\n\n    - NH₄H₂PO₄ (monoammonium phosphate) = acid source.\n\n\n\n**Liquid (controls expansion):**\n\n- Water → standard expansion.\n\n- **Colloidal silica “special liquid”** → expansion booster.\n\n- Increases setting expansion + thermal expansion.\n\n- Also reduces the early thermal shrinkage seen when mixed with water.\n\n\n\n## B) Setting reaction (Room temperature) — what type of reaction?\n\n✅ **Acid–base reaction** (like a cement)\n\n- **Acid**: NH₄H₂PO₄\n\n- **Base**: MgO\n\n\n\n**Key equation (high yield):**\n\n**NH₄H₂PO₄ + MgO + 5H₂O → NH₄MgPO₄ · 6H₂O**\n\n*(Ammonium Phosphate + Magnesia + Water → Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate / Struvite)*\n\n\n\nThat product (magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate) forms a rigid binder matrix that locks the silica filler grains together.\n\n\n\n## C) What happens on heating (burnout / furnace changes)?\n\nWhen heated, the binder dehydrates + decomposes:\n\n- **What you notice**: Ammonia smell can occur (binder breakdown products).\n\n- **What it becomes (final high-temp binder)**: The set binder converts mainly to magnesium pyrophosphate (**Mg₂P₂O₇**).\n\n- By high temperature, it behaves like a ceramic-like refractory mass that can withstand molten metal.\n\n\n\n⭐  **Exam Key Point: “How to get MORE expansion?”**\n\nIf the question asks: “How do you increase mold expansion for a base-metal crown/framework?”\n\n✅ **Replace water with colloidal silica special liquid** (or increase its concentration).\n\nThat increases:\n\n- Setting expansion.\n\n- Thermal expansion.\n\n(And it reduces the early 200–400°C shrinkage seen with water mixes.)\n\n\n\n## D) Carbon controversy (high yield)\n\n- Carbon helps divesting/clean casting, BUT for high palladium alloys there’s concern about interaction/embrittlement; palladium reacting with carbon around high temperatures (~1500°C range), so **carbon-free phosphate investment** may be preferred in those cases.\n\n\n\n# 7) Ethyl silicate–bonded investments (silica-bonded) — LESS COMMON NOW\n\n\n\n### Where used:\n\n- Historically important for some high-fusing base-metal RPD casting; use has declined because technique is more complex.\n\n\n\n## Ethyl silicate–bonded investment: setting + green (high-yield) shrinkage\n\n\n\n### 1) Key Reactions (Binder Formation)\n\n**Step 1 — Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis** (HCl is the catalyst). HCl + water start the reaction by hydrolyzing ethyl silicate (TEOS):\n\n**Si(OC₂H₅)₄ + 4H₂O (with HCl catalyst) → Si(OH)₄ + 4C₂H₅OH**\n\n*(Silanols (Si–OH) + ethanol)*\n\n\n\n**Step 2 — Condensation / polymerization** → “silica gel” binder. Those Si–OH groups join to form a 3-D gel network:\n\n**Si–OH + HO–Si → Si–O–Si + H₂O**\n\n\n\n**Step 3 — The gel binds the filler** (not “reacts to form ethyl silicate”). The gel coats/bridges the quartz/cristobalite grains and sets. Later, drying causes green shrinkage (loss of alcohol + water).\n\n\n\n> In ethyl silicate–bonded investment, the ethyl silicate liquid undergoes hydrolysis (water breaks Si–OR bonds to form Si–OH), then condensation/gelation forms a silica gel network that coats and bridges the refractory silica filler grains, acting as a glue to hold the particles together.\n\n\n\n![Shrinkage Compensation](assets/investment/investment_img_13_1.png)\n\n\n\n### 2) Two shrinkages you MUST mention (this is the exam hook)\n\n\n\n**A) Setting shrinkage**\n\n- Happens during gel formation / setting of the binder.\n\n- It reduces mold dimensions.\n\n\n\n**B) Green shrinkage (IMPORTANT)**\n\n- Happens during drying of the set gel before high-heat burnout.\n\n- As the gel dries (loses alcohol + water), it undergoes additional volumetric contraction.\n\n- This extra contraction is called **green shrinkage**, and it is additive to setting shrinkage.\n\n\n\n✅ **Total mold reduction (before casting):**\n\n**Total Shrinkage = Setting Shrinkage + Green Shrinkage**\n\n\n\n### Why it matters clinically:\n\nTo get accurate castings, mold enlargement must compensate for:\n\n**Compensation Required = Alloy Casting Shrinkage + Setting Shrinkage + Green Shrinkage**\n\nThat’s the key “why ethyl silicate systems are technique-sensitive.”\n\n\n\n### 4) Extra high-yield handling note\n\n- More complicated; flammable alcohol is released during heating → burnout/handling needs care.\n\n",n=["Refractory (Silica) provides thermal expansion and heat resistance.","Binder (Gypsum/Phosphate) provides strength and holds the refractory.","Gypsum-bonded investments cannot be heated above 700°C (decomposition).","Phosphate-bonded investments are used for PFM and base metal alloys.","Phosphate-bonded investments are currently the most widely used and considered the best investment material.","Hygroscopic expansion can significantly increase the total mold expansion.","Colloidal silica 'special liquid' in phosphate investments increases both setting and thermal expansion.","Ethyl silicate systems involve hydrolysis and condensation to form a silica gel binder.","Green shrinkage is a unique challenge in ethyl silicate-bonded investments."],i=[{id:"inv_mcq_2",question:"Dental investments are mainly composed of:",options:[" Wax + resin + water"," Refractory + binder + modifiers"," Metal + flux"," Acrylic resin + catalyst"],correctAnswerIndex:1,explanation:"Core formula = filler (silica) + binder + modifiers."},{id:"inv_mcq_3",question:"A “sprue” is best defined as:",options:[" A wax hardener used on dies"," The channel in investment through which molten metal flows"," The ring liner inside the casting ring"," The water bath used for hygroscopic expansion"],correctAnswerIndex:1,explanation:"Sprue = channel for molten metal flow in the mold."},{id:"inv_mcq_4",question:"The investment material must be:",options:[" Soluble in water so it can be washed away"," Refractory and thermally stable at casting temperatures"," Soft to allow easy carving"," Metallic to conduct heat"],correctAnswerIndex:1,explanation:"It must withstand high temperatures without breaking down."},{id:"inv_mcq_5",question:"“Investment” is:",options:[" Wax used for patterns"," Ceramic mold material into which alloys are cast"," A die spacer paint"," A ring liner"],correctAnswerIndex:1,explanation:"Investment = ceramic mold into which metal is cast."},{id:"inv_mcq_6",question:"The common refractory used in investments is:",options:[" Zinc oxide"," Silica allotropes"," Calcium hydroxide"," Sodium alginate"],correctAnswerIndex:1,explanation:"Refractory filler is mostly silica .(quartz/cristobalite/tridymite)"},{id:"inv_mcq_7",question:"In investments, the “binder” mainly functions to:",options:[" Melt the alloy B holding silica filler particles together"," Prevent wax burnout"," Remove oxides from casting"],correctAnswerIndex:1,explanation:"Binder cements silica grains into a rigid mass.
