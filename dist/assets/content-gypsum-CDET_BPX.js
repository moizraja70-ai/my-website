Dimensional accuracy  \n2. Adequate mechanical properties  \n3. Must be **fluid at pouring** to capture fine detail  \n4. **Low contact angle** (better wetting → fewer surface voids)  \n5. <span style="color: red">Strong + hard enough to resist fracture/abrasion (wax carving)</span>  \n6. Compatible with other materials\n\n---\n\n## 3) Production (<span style="color: red">calcination</span>) — how powders are made\n\n![Image](assets/gypsum_img_3_1.png)\n\n**Key idea**  \nDental gypsum powders are **hemihydrates** made by heating gypsum (dihydrate). When mixed with water, they **revert back to dihydrate and set**.\n\n**Calcination reaction (slides)**  \n**2CaSO₄·2H₂O → (CaSO₄)₂·H₂O + 3H₂O**\n\n**Comparison of Types:**\n\n### β-hemihydrate (Plaster of Paris / dental plaster)  \n● Produced in **open containers/kettle** (~120°C; your text: 110–130°C).  \n● Particles are **irregular, porous (“spongy”)** → need **more water** → weaker.\n\n### α-hemihydrate (Dental stone)  \n● Produced in a **wet environment/steam pressure** (autoclave/kettle/vat/rotary kiln).  \n● Particles are **denser, prismatic/regular** → need **less water** → stronger.\n\n### Modified α-hemihydrate (Die stone; Type IV/V)  \n● produced under pressure in **30% CaCl₂** or with **>1% sodium succinate**, then washed with hot water to remove residues.  \n● boiling gypsum in salt solution like **CaCl₂** to get even less porosity.\n\n### Overheating vs underheating  \n● **Overheating → anhydrite (CaSO₄)**  \n● **Underheating → residual dihydrate remains**  \nBoth **strongly affect setting characteristics**.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Setting of gypsum (what happens after mixing with water)\n\n✅ **Critical question answer :**  \nWhen hemihydrate powder is mixed with water → it **sets back to dihydrate** (solid gypsum) and releases **heat** (exothermic).\n\n**Three theories**  \n● Colloidal theory  \n● Hydration theory  \n● ✅ **Most accepted: Dissolution–precipitation theory**\n\n**Dissolution–precipitation (high yield steps)**  \n1. Hemihydrate + water → workable suspension  \n2. Hemihydrate dissolves → saturated Ca²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ solution  \n3. Solution becomes supersaturated with dihydrate → **dihydrate precipitates**  \n4. More hemihydrate dissolves as dihydrate keeps precipitating → crystals grow & interlock until reaction ends\n\n**Why this works:**  \nHemihydrate solubility ≈ **4×** dihydrate near room temperature.  \nBecause **dihydrate is much less soluble in water than hemihydrate**, the water can’t “hold” it in solution—so it **comes out of the water as crystals** and sets. And when water evaporates we are left with hard dental stone/plaster\n\n**Extra:** Set gypsum often doesn’t reach 100% conversion quickly; some unreacted hemihydrate may remain\n\n![Image](assets/gypsum_img_5_1.png)\n\n<video src="/assets/Living_microscopic_scene_1080p_202601110631.mp4"></video>\n\n| Type | Name | Description & Particle | W/P Ratio | Primary Use |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **I** | **Impression Plaster** | β-hemihydrate + chemicals.

By **~24 hours**, gypsum is usually considered **“dry strength” range** for practical purposes (much harder/stronger than at 1 hour).  \n● **Up to ~7 days:** Strength can continue to rise and may **roughly double** compared with the 1-hour wet strength (depends on product and drying conditions).\n\n**If you want one line to memorize**  \n**“Green strength = first hour; most drying strength gain occurs by ~24 hours; further increase continues up to about a week.”**\n\n● **Dry strength:** after drying → can be **2× or more higher**\n\n**Main determinants**  \n● Strength depends mainly on **porosity** and **time allowed to dry**.\n\n**<span style="color: red">W/P ratio effect</span>**  \n● ↑W/P → ↑porosity → ↓dry strength (compressive strength inversely proportional to W/P).\n\n**<span style="color: red">Manipulation effects</span>**  \nIncreasing mixing time increases strength up to a limit (~equivalent to hand mixing 1 min), but **overmixing breaks the crystal network** → weaker.  \n● Accelerators/retarders can lower wet and dry strength.\n\n**Drying speed**  \n● **Microwave irradiation** can speed drying; some studies show possible dimensional change.\n\n**<span style="color: red">Surface hardness / abrasion</span>**  \n● Surface hardness relates to compressive strength and increases faster than bulk strength.  \n● Abrasion resistance can increase when impregnated with epoxy resins; hardness improved by mixing with hardening solutions (e.g., colloidal silica mentioned).\n\n---\n\n## 9) <span style="color: red">Types of gypsum products (ISO/ADA 5 types)</span>\n\nSlides list ISO types:  \n1. **Type I**: Dental plaster (impression)  \n2. **Type II**: Dental plaster (model)  \n3. **Type III**: Dental stone (die/model)  \n4. **Type IV**: Die stone (high strength, low expansion)  \n5. **Type V**: Die stone (high strength, high expansion)\n\nclinical logic:  \n● Type III for denture casts (tolerates slight expansion)  \n● Type IV for dies needing strength + low expansion  \n● Type V has higher expansion to compensate higher casting shrinkage of newer base-metal alloys; avoid for inlays/onlays because fit may become too tight (from your text)\n\n---\n\n## 10) Manipulation (how to get a clean cast) — HAND mixing (slides) <span style="color: red">skip</span>\n\n● Use a clean, scratch-free rubber/plastic bowl (~130 mm top diameter) + stiff spatula.  \n● Add measured water, **add powder slowly over ~10 s**, mix/spatulate ~**60 s** (circular/figure-8).  \n● Clean the bowl after each mix because residues alter working/setting.\n\n**Reduce porosity (slides) < — <span style="color: green">do this</span>**  \n● Air can be incorporated during mixing → porosity/weakness  \nBest: vacuum mixing (under vacuum) + vibration during pouring.  \n● **Vacuum mixing** removes air from the mix (biggest reduction in porosity).  \n● **Vibration** then helps the mix flow into details and releases any remaining bubbles while pouring.\n\n---\n\n## 11) Storage + cast care  \n● Hemihydrate absorbs moisture from air; high humidity can start partial hydration → changes setting time.  \n● Store in a dry** atmosphere**; seal in a moisture-proof container.  \n● Cast soaking: safest in **calcium-sulfate–saturated water** (with gypsum debris at bottom)\n\n---\n\n## <span style="color: red">Types of dental gypsum (Type I–V) — what each is used for + why it fits that job</span>\n\nThe **reason types exist** is mainly differences in:  \n● **Crystal form/packing** (β vs α vs modified α)  \n● **Water/powder (W/P) ratio needed**  \n● Resulting **porosity → strength/hardness**  \n● **Setting expansion**\n\nLower W/P → **less porosity → stronger + harder**, but usually **more technique-sensitive**.\n\n---\n\n## Type I — Impression Plaster\n\n**Where used**  \n● Historically for **impressions** (rare today)\n\n**Why it was suitable**  \n● **Very low setting expansion** (so impression stays accurate)  \n● Can be formulated to set relatively fast\n\n**Why it’s NOT used now**  \n● Sets **rigid** and fractures/locks in undercuts → difficult to remove safely from teeth/soft tissue undercuts.  \n● Replaced by elastomers/hydrocolloids (flexible).\n\n**Key idea:** Impression materials need **accuracy + safe removal**;
