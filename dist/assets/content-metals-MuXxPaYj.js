**low carbon solubility**.\n- **Austenite (γ-Fe)**\n  - **FCC** structure.\n  - Higher carbon solubility; tough/ductile at higher temperature.\n- **Cementite (Fe₃C)**\n  - Very hard, brittle iron carbide.\n- **Delta ferrite (δ-Fe)**\n  - High-temperature **BCC** phase.\n\n### B) Common steel microstructures\n- **Pearlite** = **ferrite + cementite** lamellae\n  - Strength ↑, ductility ↓ compared with ferrite.\n- **Martensite**\n  - Formed by rapid quenching (diffusionless transformation).\n  - Very hard, brittle unless tempered.\n- **Tempered martensite**\n  - Balance of hardness + improved toughness.\n\n### C) What ferrochromium does in steel (Fe–Cr additive)\n- Adds **chromium (Cr)** to steel.\n  - Enables **Cr₂O₃** passive film → **corrosion resistance ↑** (stainless behavior).\n  - **Hardenability ↑** and **oxidation resistance ↑**.\n  - Forms hard **chromium carbides** → **wear resistance ↑** (when carbon is present).\n\n### D) What carbon does in steel (high-yield)\n- Increasing **carbon (C)** generally causes:\n  - **Hardness ↑**, **strength ↑**, **wear resistance ↑**.\n  - **Ductility ↓**, **toughness ↓** (more brittle tendency).\n  - Supports formation of **Fe₃C (cementite)** and **martensite**.\n\n### E) Chromium + carbon issue: sensitization (exam concept)\n- At certain temperatures (e.g., overheating/welding range):\n  - **Cr + C → chromium carbides** (e.g., **Cr₂₃C₆**) at grain boundaries.\n  - This creates nearby **chromium-depleted zones**.\n  - ✅ Chromium depletion → weaker passivation → **intergranular corrosion risk**.\n- **Prevention concepts**: Use **low-carbon stainless** (e.g., **L-grades**) or stabilized steels (e.g., **Ti/Nb stabilized**) to tie up carbon.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Nitinol (NiTi): Key Details for Dentistry\n- **NiTi (Nitinol)** = **Nickel–Titanium alloy** used in:\n  - **Orthodontic wires**.\n  - **Endodontic rotary files**.\n\n### Key behaviors\n- **Shape memory**: deformation → heat/body temperature → returns toward original shape.\n- **Superelasticity**: stress causes reversible phase change → large elastic deflection.\n\n### NiTi phases (high-yield)\n- **Austenite** (parent phase).\n- **Martensite** (more easily deformed phase).\n- **R-phase** may exist as an intermediate.\n\n### Clinical pros/cons\n- **Ortho**: more **constant, gentle force** over a range of activation.\n- **Endo**: high **flexibility** helps follow curved canals.\n- ✅ **Risks**: **cyclic fatigue** (curved canals) and **torsional fracture** (binding).\n\n---\n\n## 6) RPD Clasps: Metallic Properties\n### Rest (support)\n- Must be **rigid** and **strong** (no flex).\n- ✅ Provides **vertical support** and helps define fulcrum behavior.\n\n### Retentive arm\n- Must have **controlled flexibility**, mainly in the **terminal third**.\n- The **terminal tip** flexes over the height of contour → engages the undercut.\n- ✅ Flexible enough to engage undercut without stressing the abutment.\n\n### Reciprocal arm / reciprocal plate\n- Must be **rigid** (non-flexing).\n- ✅ Provides **reciprocation + bracing**, countering lateral forces from the retentive arm.\n\n### Minor connector\n- Must be **rigid** and dimensionally stable.\n- ✅ Transmits forces between the clasp and the framework.\n\n### Approach arm (bar clasp)\n- Origin/body should be relatively **rigid**, with **flexibility near the terminal**.\n- Designed to approach undercut from the gingival direction.\n- ✅ Must flex without permanently deforming, then return to passive position.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n## 8) Critical Exam Questions (High-Yield Essentials)\n\n### Q: Why do metal properties differ so much from ceramics or polymers?\n- **A**: **Metallic bonding** (the "electron sea"). It allows for nondirectional bonds, high thermal/electrical conductivity, and **ductility**. Ceramics have ionic/covalent bonds which are directional and brittle.\n\n### Q: Why aren\'t pure metals (like pure gold) usually used for cast restorations?\n- **A**: They are typically **too soft** and have low yield strength. Alloying is required to improve hardness, strength, and tarnish resistance.\n\n### Q: Why does faster cooling result in smaller grains?\n- **A**: Faster cooling (large supercooling) creates many stable nuclei at once. Because many grains start growing simultaneously, they collide quickly and cannot grow large. **Smaller grains = stronger metal (Hall-Petch effect)**.\n\n### Q: What is the benefit of Iridium (Ir) or Ruthenium (Ru) in gold alloys?\n- **A**: They act as **grain refiners**. They provide artificial sites for heterogeneous nucleation, ensuring a fine, uniform grain structure that is less likely to crack during adjustment.\n\n### Q: What is the most common metal allergy in dentistry?\n- **A**: **Nickel (Ni)**. It is frequently found in base metal alloys (Ni-Cr) and stainless steel.\n\n![Grain Refinement & Strengthening](assets/metals/metals_img_14_1.png)\n',t=["Alloy: Mixture of two or more metals.","Phase diagrams: Solid solutions (substitutional vs interstitial).","Heat treatment affects properties (e.g., gold alloys)."],i="\n# Metals are a low yielding topic\n## Dental alloys — ultra-high-yield concise notes\n\n---\n\n### 1)Why “Metal” Is Hard to Define (Clinical View)\n\n- ● A textbook definition (**good heat/electric conductor**, **lustrous**, **reflective**) is not enough for dentistry because clinicians care about:\n\n  - ▫️ **Plaque adhesion**\n\n  - ▫️ **Porcelain bonding**\n\n  - ▫️ **Joining/soldering**\n\n  - ▫️ **Fit**\n\n  - ▫️ **Opposing wear**\n\n  - ▫️ **Biocompatibility**\n\n  - ▫️ **Corrosion/tarnish**\n---\n\n### 2)  Metals vs Alloys (Important)\n\n- ● Dentistry mostly uses **alloys (not pure metals)**, because pure metals are usually too **soft** and/or **corrode**.\n\n- ● Exception examples:\n\n  - ▫️ **Gold foil** (direct filling)\n\n  - ▫️ **Commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti)**\n\n  - ▫️ **Silver points**\n\n\n---\n\n### 3) What Cast Metals Are Used For\n\n- ● **All-metal**: **inlays**, **onlays**, **partial crowns**, **full crowns**, **bridges**, **posts/cores**\n\n- ● **Frameworks**: **PFM (metal-ceramic)** and **metal-resin** prostheses\n\n- ● **RPD frameworks** + **implant abutments**\n\n---\n\n### 4) Dental Alloy Groups (Core Classification) — **IMP**\n\n| Classification | Definition | Typical Uses |\n|---|---|---|\n| **High Noble (HN)** | **≥ 40% Au** and **≥ 60% total noble metal** | Crowns, bridges, inlays (**excellent corrosion resistance**). |\n| **Noble (N)** | **≥ 25% total noble metal** | PFM frameworks, bridges (**good balance of cost/performance**). |\n| **Predominantly Base (PB)** | **< 25% noble metal**<br>Common systems: **Ni-Cr**, **Co-Cr**, **Fe-C-Cr**, **CP-Ti**, **Ti-Al-V** | Partial dentures, specific crowns (**high strength**, relies on **passivation**). |\n| **Amalgam** | “Amalgam contains metals, but it doesn’t behave like a typical metal.

Supercooling (The Strength Factor)**\n\n  - ▫️ The Physics: the metal drops below its freezing point to find the energy to start crystallizing.\n\n  - ▫️ Dentist Relevance: determines the **Grain Size**.\n\n    - ○ If the metal supercools naturally (without help), it forms large, tree-like crystals (**dendrites**).\n\n    - ○ Consequence: large grains make the metal brittle. A clasp made this way will snap when you try to adjust it.\n\n- ● **2. Nucleation (The “Grain Refiner” Step)**\n\n  - ▫️ The Physics: tiny crystal seeds form and solidification starts.\n\n  - ▫️ Dentist Relevance: why you pay extra for alloys with **Iridium** or **Ruthenium** (**Grain Refiners**).\n\n    - ○ These elements act as artificial “seeds” that force nucleation to happen everywhere at once.\n\n    - ○ Consequence: creates **Fine Grains**, which makes the alloy significantly stronger and allows you to burnish the margins without flaking.\n\n- ● **3. Latent Heat Release / Recalescence (The “Hot Tear” Risk)**\n\n  - ▫️ The Physics: the metal releases heat as it turns solid, warming itself back up.\n\n  - ▫️ Dentist Relevance: release of heat keeps the metal “mushy” for longer.\n\n    - ○ If your mold is too hot (high burnout temp), this extra heat can prevent thin sections (like margins) from freezing quickly enough.\n\n    - ○ Consequence: leads to **Hot Tears**—micro-cracks in the metal that cause the casting to fail under stress.\n\n- ● **4. The Plateau (The “Do Not Touch” Phase)**\n\n  - ▫️ The Physics: the temperature stays flat while the metal finishes freezing.\n\n  - ▫️ Dentist Relevance: the casting is a fragile mix of solid crystals floating in liquid.\n\n    - ○ Consequence: if you or the technician move or bump the casting ring during this glow phase, you will fracture the internal structure.\n\n    - ○ The casting will likely break when you try to seat it.\n\n- ● **5. Solid Cooling (The Fit)**\n\n  - ▫️ The Physics: the fully solid metal cools down to room temperature and contracts.\n\n  - ▫️ Dentist Relevance: **Shrinkage** (TF → Room Temp).\n\n    - ○ Consequence: this is why your **investment material must expand**.\n\n    - ○ If investment expansion doesn’t perfectly match this cooling shrinkage → crown too tight or won’t seat at all.\n\n- ● Just remember:\n\n  - ▫️ Supercooling means the liquid’s temperature drops below its freezing point (Tf) because freezing needs a starting point (**a nucleus**).\n\n  - ▫️ Analogy: the car is on, but it still needs acceleration to actually move forward — just like the liquid is “ready to freeze,” but without a nucleus it doesn’t start yet (like gypsum nucleation).\n\n- ● **Diagram space**:\n\n  - ▫️ ![Solidification Graph](assets/metals/SOLIDIFICATION.png)\n\n---\n\n### 10) MICROSTRUCTURE (Can Skip — Very Extensive Explanation)\n\n#### A) Atom → Grain → Boundary → Dislocation → Slip (Simplest Build)\n\n- ● **1) Atom**\n\n  - ▫️ An atom is the smallest “unit” of the metal (**Au atom**, **Cu atom**, etc.).\n\n  - ▫️ ![Atom Structure](assets/metals/ATOM%20STRUCUTRE.png)\n\n- ● **2) Atoms in solid metal don’t sit randomly**\n\n  - ▫️ When metal solidifies, atoms stack in a repeating pattern like a 3D wallpaper.\n\n  - ▫️ That repeating pattern = **crystal lattice (FCC/BCC/HCP)**.\n\n  - ▫️ Analogy: bricks stacked in a repeating way.\n\n  - ✅ **FCC is the most common one in dentistry**\n- ▫️ ![Crystal Structure 1](assets/metals/CRYSTAL%20ALTTICE.png)\n---\n\n#### B) Crystal vs Grain (Polycrystal)\n\n- ● **3) Crystal (one “ordered block”)**\n\n  - ▫️ Definition: a region where atoms are stacked in one continuous, unbroken pattern.\n\n  - ▫️ In a “single crystal,” the entire material is one solid block of perfect order.\n\n  - ▫️ Analogy: a perfectly tiled floor where every single tile is laid straight, covering the entire room without a break.\n\n  - ▫️ ![Tiled Floor Analogy](assets/metals/TILED_FLOOR.png)\n\n| Feature | Crystal (Single) | Grain (Polycrystal) | CAN SKIP \n|---|---|---|\n| Structure | One giant, perfect block. | Many small blocks stuck together. |\n| Orientation | Same direction everywhere. | Changes direction from one grain to the next. |\n| Boundaries | None (internal perfection). | Separated by “Grain Boundaries.” |\n| Commonality | Rare (specialty tech). | Standard (almost all dental metals). |\n\n- ● **4) Grain = a tiny crystal region in the metal**\n\n  - ▫️ A real casting (metal) is not one giant crystal. It’s made of many tiny crystals.\n\n  - ✅ **Grain = a small crystal chunk** where atoms are lined up in the same pattern and the same direction.\n\n  - ▫️ ![Grain Structure](assets/metals/GRAIN.png)\n\n  - ▫️ Analogy: a tiled floor made of patches:\n\n    - ○ One patch of tiles all pointing the same way = one grain\n\n    - ○ Next patch tiles rotated a bit = another grain\n\n\n\n\n- ● **5) Why do grains exist?**\n\n  - ▫️ During solidification, many crystals start growing at many different spots at the same time (many “starts” = nucleation).\n\n  - ▫️ Each start grows in its own direction. Eventually they meet.\n\n- ● **6) Grain boundary = where two grains meet**\n\n  - ▫️ When two grains with different directions collide, you get a “seam”.\n\n  - ✅ **Grain boundary = the border/seam** between two grains with different orientations.\n\n  - ▫️ Analogy: the line where two different tile patches meet.\n - ▫️ ![Grain Boundary](assets/metals/metals_page_11_img_1.png)---\n\n#### C) Dislocations + Slip (Why Metals Bend)\n\n- ● **7) Dislocation = the “defect line” that lets metal deform**\n\n  - ▫️ A perfect lattice would be super strong. Real metals have dislocations (built-in line defects).\n\n  - ✅ **Dislocation = a line where the atomic layers are mis-stacked (an extra atom)**\n\n  - ▫️ It’s why we can bend metal: it’s a weak point that can move.\n\n  - ▫️ Arm analogy:\n\n    - ○ The Normal Arm (Perfect Crystal): rigid bone; if you force it, it snaps (fracture).\n\n    - ○ The “Extra Joint” (Dislocation): a “mistake” but allows bending in a new place.\n\n  - ✅ Key takeaway: defects (dislocations) sound bad, but they are the only reason metals are useful. Without these “extra joints,” a metal spoon would shatter like glass if you tried to bend it.\n\n  \n\n- ● **Malleability** = ability to deform under **compression** (hammer/press into shape).\n\n- ● **Ductility** = ability to deform under **tension** (stretch/elongate into a wire).\n\n    - ▫️ ![Ductility and Malleability](assets/metals/DUCILITY%20AND%20MEALIBILITY.png)\n \n\nAnalogy:If you want the tile analogy, think of it like an extra tile—something we don’t usually need—so it can move pretty easily because it isn’t “locked in” like the rest. \n\n\n![Dislocation](assets/metals/DISLOCATION.png)\n\n  \n\n- ● **8) Slip = dislocation movement (this is how metal bends)**\n\n  - ▫️ When you bend a metal, atoms don’t all shift together.\n\n  - ▫️ Instead the dislocation moves, and the metal changes shape gradually.\n\n  - ▫️ It moves in straight directions (up/down/left/right) → called a **slip plane** (dislocation slips in a 2D plane like a ball rolling on a table).\n\n\n\n  - ▫️ EXTRA INFO:\n\n    - ○ When shaping an **Adams clasp** or making letters from wire for practice adjusting a denture clasp, dislocations move.\n\n    - ○ With repeated bending, dislocations pile up and get tangled → wire becomes more rigid/hard and less ductile.\n\n    - ○ Keep bending back and forth → can crack and break.\n\n  - ✅ **Slip = a dislocation moving along a slip plane** (same plane left/right up/down)\n\n  - ▫️ Analogy:\n\n    - ○ Track/road = slip plane\n\n    - ○ Car/train = dislocation (moves forward/reverse only on its track)\n\n  - ▫️ ![Slip Analogy](assets/metals/metals_page_13_img_1.png)\n\n---\n\n#### D) Why Grain Boundaries Strengthening Metals (Exam Rule)\n\n- ● **9) Why grain boundaries “block” dislocations**\n\n  - ▫️ Inside one grain, dislocation has a clear track (slip plane).\n\n  - ▫️ At the grain boundary, the next grain is rotated, so the track doesn’t line up.\n\n  - ✅ Dislocation gets stuck or needs extra force to continue.\n\n  - ▫️ Train analogy:\n\n    - ○ Inside a grain = rails are straight\n\n    - ○ Grain boundary = rails end\n\n    - ○ Next grain = rails rotated → not connected → train can’t pass easily\n\n    - ▫️ ![Annealing](assets/metals/metals_page_15_img_1.png)\n\n  - ▫️ ![Grain Boundaries](assets/metals/metals_page_14_img_1.png)\n\n- ● **10) The exam rule (super important)**\n\n  - ✅ More grain boundaries = more stopping points = **stronger metal**\n\n  - ✅ Smaller grains → **stronger/harder** (but usually **less ductile**)\n\n---\n\n- ● Tile analogy (TO SUMARIZE EVERYTHIGN IN SINGLE PARAGRAPH):\n\n  - ▫️ One tile is like the repeating crystal pattern. A bunch of the same tiles, all facing the same direction, is one grain (one country). The lines separating different tile directions are grain boundaries (the border between countries).\n\n  - ▫️ Sometimes the metal has a defect—like an “extra/misplaced tile” that can move easily (dislocation).\n\n  - ▫️ Because it can move, it lets the metal deform along a slip plane (moving mainly in one direction—up/down or left/right), but mostly within the same country/grain where the tile pattern is the same.\n\n  - ▫️ If it tries to cross the border (grain boundary) into another country/grain, the tile pattern doesn’t match, so it gets blocked and stress builds up at the border.\n\n  - ▫️ That tension can lead to problems, and if it becomes too much, it can cause cracks/fractures.\n\n  - ▫️ This is not necessarily a bad thing because it can increase the strength of a metal (strengthening).

They are generally stiffer, harder, and less expensive than noble alloys.\n\n## 1) Classification & Applications\nThe two primary groups in dentistry are:\n- **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr)**: Primarily used for **RPD frameworks**. They are very hard, stiff, and have high proportional limits, enabling them to withstand high stresses without permanent deformation.\n- **Nickel-Chromium (Ni-Cr)**: Primarily used for **PFM copings** and small castings (crowns/bridges). They have better castability and density than Co-Cr.\n\n## 2) Key Alloying Elements\n- **Chromium (Cr)**: The most critical element (usually >20%).\n  - **Passivation**: Forms a tenacious **Cr₂O₃** oxide film that blocks corrosion.\n  - **Hardening**: Provides solid-solution hardening.\n- **Cobalt (Co)**: Increases stiffness (modulus) and strength.\n- **Nickel (Ni)**: Increases ductility and reduces hardness. **Note**: 10-15% of the population (especially females) has a **Nickel allergy**.\n- **Molybdenum/Manganese**: Refine grain structure and improve casting behavior.\n- **Silicon**: Imparts good casting properties and increases ductility.\n- **Beryllium (Be)**: Sometimes added to Ni-Cr to lower the melting range and improve castability. \n  - ⚠️ **CAUTION**: Beryllium is a known carcinogen (Berylliosis) and its use is strictly regulated or declining.\n\n## 3) The Critical Role of Carbon\nCarbon concentration is a major factor controlling alloy properties:\n- **Controlled Carbon**: Increases hardness, strength, and proportional limit.\n- **Excess Carbon**: Results in a **brittle alloy** with very low ductility and an increased danger of fracture.\n\n## 4) Passivation: The "Shield" Concept\nBase metals are chemically reactive but "self-protect" by forming a stable oxide layer. \n- **Self-Healing**: If the layer is scratched, it reforms in the presence of oxygen.\n- **Breakdown**: Crevices or high-chloride environments (saliva) can lead to **pitting** or **crevice corrosion**.\n\n## 5) Titanium & Modern Implantology\n- **Commercially Pure Titanium (CP-Ti)**: Grades 1-4 are used for implants due to exceptional biocompatibility.\n- **Ti-6Al-4V**: An alloy (Aluminium/Vanadium) used when higher strength is required.\n- **Biocompatibility**: Relies on a stable **TiO₂** layer that allows for **osseointegration**.\n\n## 6) Clinical Considerations\n- **Polishing**: Due to their extreme hardness (especially Co-Cr), base metal alloys are very difficult to polish and adjust.\n- **Opposing Wear**: Their hard surface is more likely to cause wear on opposing natural dentition compared to gold allies.\n- **Density**: Ni-Cr has higher density than Co-Cr, resulting in better thrust during casting and fewer voids.\n\n![Basal Metal Alloys - Passivation](assets/metals/metals_page_3_img_1.png)\n',o=["Wrought: Shaped by plastic deformation (cold working).","Fibrous microstructure (not cast grains).","Examples: Orthodontic wires (SS, NiTi, Beta-Ti)."],r="\n# Wrought Alloys\n\nWrought alloys are shaped by **mechanical working** (rolling, drawing, bending) at temperatures well below the recrystallization point (**cold working**). This process fundamentally changes their microstructure and properties compared to cast alloys.\n\n## 1) Microstructure & Strain Hardening\n- **Fibrous Grain Structure**: Unlike the equiaxed grains of cast alloys, wrought grains become **elongated and fibrous** in the direction of work.\n- **Dislocation Density**: Cold working massively increases the number of dislocations. These dislocations tangle and pile up, making further slip difficult.\n- **Strain Hardening (Work Hardening)**: \n  - ✅ **Strength ↑** and **Hardness ↑**.\n  - ⚠️ **Ductility ↓** and **Toughness ↓** (metal becomes brittle).\n\n## 2) Reversing the Effect: Annealing\nAnnealing is a heat treatment used to reset the properties of cold-worked metal:\n1. **Recovery**: Internal stresses are relieved; minimal changes in properties.\n2. **Recrystallization**: New, strain-free equiaxed grains form. **Ductility returns**, and hardness drops.\n3. **Grain Growth**: If heated too long, grains coarsen, and strength decreases.\n\n## 3) Steel Phases (High-Yield Core)\nSteel is an alloy of Iron (Fe) and Carbon (C). Its behavior depends on its phase structure:\n- **Austenite (γ-Fe)**: **FCC** structure. Stable at high temperatures (>723°C). Tough and ductile.\n- **Ferrite (α-Fe)**: **BCC** structure. Soft, ductile, but low carbon solubility.\n- **Cementite (Fe₃C)**: Iron carbide. **Very hard and brittle**.\n- **Pearlite**: A lamellar mixture of ferrite and cementite.\n- **Martensite**: Formed by **rapid quenching** of austenite. It has a distorted BCC lattice and is **extremely hard and brittle**.\n\n![Phase Diagram](assets/metals/metals_page_18_img_1.png)\n\n## 4) Hardening and Tempering\n- **Quenching**: Austenite → Martensite (Hardest possible state).\n- **Tempering**: Heating martensite to 200–400°C to allow partial conversion to ferrite and cementite. This reduces brittleness and restores **toughness**.\n\n![Tempering Cycle](assets/metals/metals_page_21_img_1.png)\n\n## 5) Stainless Steel & Corrosion\nStainless steel contains >12% **Chromium**.\n- **18/8 Stainless Steel**: Contains 18% Cr and 8% Ni. This is the **Austenitic** type used for orthodontic wires.\n- **Weld Decay (Sensitization)**: Overheating causes Cr to react with C to form **Chromium Carbides** at grain boundaries.

Clean surfaces of pure gold form metallic bonds upon contact under pressure, without the application of heat.\n- **Key Condition**: The surface must be absolutely free of adsorbed gases (like ammonia), grease, or moisture.\n\n### B) Clinical Handling & Preparation\n- **Isolation**: Absolute isolation (rubber dam) is **mandatory**. Moisture completely ruins the cohesive property.\n- **Degassing (Annealing)**: Before use, the gold is heated (e.g., to ~250°C) to remove any adsorbed contaminants. This "annealing" restores the gold to its most cohesive state.\n- **Condensation**: The gold is built up incrementally (pieces are 0.001 mm thick). Each layer is condensed with high pressure to create a dense, void-free mass.\n- **Sandwich Foils**: Foils of gold and platinum are sometimes used to produce a restoration with improved physical characteristics.\n\n### C) Indications & Contraindications\n- ✅ **Indications**: Small conservative restorations (Class I, Class III, Class V) where longevity is the priority and technique can be perfect.\n- ❌ **Contraindications**: Large stress-bearing areas, poor isolation, or esthetic zones if the patient rejects the gold color.\n\n![Gold Foil Condensation](assets/metals/metals_page_13_img_1.png)\n\n## 5) Alloy Ordering & Heat Treatment\nTraditional gold alloys (Type III & IV) can be strengthened after casting through **age hardening**.\n- **Softening (Solution Heat Treat)**: Heat to ~700°C and **quench**.
