  content: String.raw`# General Physiology & Homeostasis

## A) SCOPE
This is the foundation of all medicine. We cover how the 100 trillion cells work together to maintain a stable environment (Homeostasis), the control systems that keep you alive (Feedback Loops), and the dynamics of body fluids.

## B) ONE-PAGE MASTER MAP (Big Picture)

- **Physiology:** The study of mechanisms. Not just what happens, but *how* and *why*.
- **The "Internal Sea" (Milieu Intérieur):** Your cells live in water (ECF), just like their ancient ancestors lived in the ocean. This fluid must be perfect.
- **Homeostasis:** The central dogma. It is **Dynamic Constancy**, not a frozen state. Like driving a car--you constantly adjust the wheel to stay straight.
- **Control Systems:**
  - **Negative Feedback:** The "Course Corrector". The response opposes the stimulus. (e.g., You get hot → You sweat → You cool down).
  - **Positive Feedback:** The "Accelerator". The response amplifies the stimulus. (e.g., Clotting cascade, Childbirth, AP upstroke). Usually pathological/vicious.
  - **Feed-Forward:** The "Anticipatory" control. Getting ready before the event (e.g., Stomach acid rises when you smell food).
- **Body Fluid Compartments:**
  - **TBW (Total Body Water):** 60% of weight. Fat people have less water (fat is hydrophobic).
  - **60-40-20 Rule:** TBW (60%) = ICF (40%) + ECF (20%).
  - **ECF:** The "Town Square" where cells trade. Divided into Plasma (in vessels) and Interstitial (between cells).
  - **Indicator Dilution Principle:** $V = Q/C$. To measure a pool's volume, dump a known amount of dye (Q), mix, and check concentration (C).

## C) CORE NOTES (THE MAIN BODY)

### 1. Homeostasis & Control Systems

#### 1) Key Concept: The "Thermostat" Analogy
Your body is a collection of control systems. Most use Negative Feedback.
- Think of a **Thermostat:** Set point is 22°C. If room heats to 25°C (Stimulus), AC turns ON (Effector), room cools to 22°C (Response). AC turns OFF. The response (cooling) negated the stimulus (heating).

#### 2) The Reflex Arc (Step-by-Step Mechanism)
1. **Stimulus:** A variable moves away from normal (e.g., Blood Pressure drops).
2. **Sensor (Receptor):** Detects the error. (Baroreceptors in neck stretch less).
3. **Afferent Pathway:** Wire to the brain. (Cranial Nerve IX/X).
4. **Integrator (Control Center):** The Boss. Compares input to "Set Point". (Medulla Oblongata sees BP is too low).
5. **Efferent Pathway:** Wire to the organs. (Sympathetic Nerves fire).
6. **Effector:** The Worker. (Heart beats faster/harder; Arteries constrict).
7. **Response:** Variable returns to set point. (BP rises back to normal).
- **Result:** The loop shuts off.

#### 3) Key Equations: Gain (System Efficiency)

$$Gain = \frac{Correction}{Error}$$

- **Correction:** How much the system moved the variable *back* towards normal.
- **Error:** How much "failure" remains.
- **Analogy:**
  - **Low Gain:** You have a fever of 40°C. You take Tylenol. It drops to 39°C. Correction = 1. Remaining Error = 2 (assuming 37 is standard). Gain = 1/2 = 0.5. (Weak system).
  - **High Gain:** You enter a sauna (100°C). Your body temp only rises 0.5°C because you sweat like crazy. Correction is massive (~60°). Error is tiny (0.5°). Gain = 120. (Powerful system).

#### 7) Clinical Correlation: "The Vicious Cycle"
- **Positive Feedback is usually bad.** Why? Because it leads to instability.
- **Death in Shock:** You lose 2L of blood → BP drops → Heart muscle gets less blood → Heart becomes weaker → Pumps less → BP drops further → Heart gets even less blood.
- The output (weak heart) amplifies the input (low BP). The cycle strengthens until death.

### 2. Body Fluid Compartments

#### 1) Key Concept: The Barriers
Imagine your body fluid as three buckets separated by filters.
1. **Bucket 1: Plasma (3.5L).** Separated from Bucket 2 by the **Capillary Wall**.
   - **Capillary Wall:** Like a tea bag. Letting water and small stuff (ions) through, but holding back the big stuff (Proteins/RBCs).
2. **Bucket 2: Interstitial Fluid (10.5L).** The fluid between cells.
3. **Bucket 3: ICF (28L).** Inside cells. Separated from Bucket 2 by the **Cell Membrane**.
   - **Cell Membrane:** Like a bouncer. Very selective. Lets water in (usually) but keeps ions strictly controlled (Na+ stays out, K+ stays in).

#### 2) Distribution Rules (The 60-40-20 Rule)
- **TBW** = 60% Body Weight. (42L in 70kg male).
- **ICF** = 40% (2/3 of TBW). Most of your water is inside cells.
- **ECF** = 20% (1/3 of TBW).
  - **ISF** = 15% (3/4 of ECF).
  - **Plasma** = 5% (1/4 of ECF).

#### 3) Measurement (Indicator Dilution)
- **ICF & ISF cannot be measured directly.** Why? Because you can't inject a tracer that goes only into cells or only between cells.
- **The Trick:**
  1. Measure TBW (D₂O - goes everywhere).
  2. Measure ECF (Inulin - crosses capillaries but stops at cell membrane).
  3. Measure Plasma (Evan's Blue - binds albumin, stays in vessels).
- **Calculation:**
  - ICF = TBW - ECF.
  - ISF = ECF - Plasma.

#### 7) Clinical Correlation: "Why do women get drunk faster?"
- **Physiology reason:** Women usually have a higher fat % than men.
- Fat is hydrophobic (no water). Muscle is hydrophilic (75% water).
- Therefore, women have **less Total Body Water per kg** than men.
- Same amount of alcohol dissolved in a smaller bucket of water = **Higher Concentration**.

## D) REFLEXES + FEEDBACK LOOPS

- **Temperature Regulation:** Hot Environment → Hypothalamus detects warm blood → Skin vessels dilate + Sweating → Heat loss → Temp drops (Negative Feedback).
- **Blood Clotting:** Vessel damage → Platelet plug → Clotting factors activate → More factors activate (Positive Feedback) → Clot forms → Stop bleeding (Negative Feedback ends the positive loop).

## E) "INCREASE VS DECREASE" EFFECTS TABLE

| If this changes... | Then this happens... |
| :--- | :--- |
| ↑ Body Fat | ↓ % TBW. (Obese person is prone to dehydration). |
| ↓ Blood Volume | ↑ ADH & Aldosterone. (Body tries to save water). |
| ↑ Feedback Gain | ↓ Oscillation. System holds set-point tighter. |
