  - Fiber types and brainstem nuclei concepts
  - Motor nuclei MEDIAL, sensory nuclei LATERAL rule

GROUP 2 (IMG 4-13): CN V TRIGEMINAL - SUPER HIGH-YIELD
Associated Text:
  1. Why CN V is #1 dental nerve (largest, main sensation, motor)
  2. Three divisions: V1 (SOF), V2 (foramen rotundum), V3 (foramen ovale)
  3. V1 branches and territories (eye, upper eyelid, forehead)
  4. V2 branches and dental supply:
     - PSA (posterior superior alveolar) → maxillary molars
     - MSA (middle superior alveolar) → premolars
     - ASA (anterior superior alveolar) → incisors/canines
     - Greater palatine → palate + palatal gingiva
     - Nasopalatine → anterior palate
  5. V3 branches and dental supply:
     - IAN (inferior alveolar) → all mandibular teeth
     - Mental nerve → lower lip/chin
     - Incisive nerve → anterior teeth region
     - Long buccal nerve → buccal gingiva of molars
     - Lingual nerve → tongue sensation + chorda tympani hitchhike (taste/salivation)
  6. Trigeminal sensory nuclei:
     - Mesencephalic (proprioception from mastication/TMJ/PDL)
     - Principal sensory (fine touch/vibration)
     - Spinal trigeminal (pain/temperature → onion-skin pattern)
  7. LOCAL ANESTHESIA BLOCKS (9 blocks detailed):
     - IANB (Inferior alveolar) - most important
     - Long buccal block
     - Mental/incisive block
     - Gow-Gates block
     - Akinosi block
     - Infraorbital block
     - PSA block
     - Greater palatine block
     - Nasopalatine block
  8. Parasympathetic "hitchhiking":
     - Lacrimal gland (VII → pterygopalatine → V2)
     - Salivary glands (VII → submandibular ganglion on V3 lingual)
     - Parotid (IX → otic ganglion → V3 auriculotemporal)
  9. Pathologies: trigeminal neuralgia, post-traumatic neuropathy, zoster, etc.
  10. Referred pain patterns

GROUP 3 (IMG 14-18): CN VII FACIAL - VERY HIGH-YIELD
Associated Text:
  1. What VII does: Motor expression, taste ant 2/3, PS to lacrimal + salivary
  2. Complete course: brainstem → internal acoustic meatus → facial canal → stylomastoid foramen → parotid
  3. Key branches in temporal bone:
     - Greater petrosal (lacrimal gland)
     - Nerve to stapedius (hearing dampening)
     - Chorda tympani (taste + PS to submandibular/sublingual)
  4. Parotid plexus: 5 terminal branches (Temporal, Zygomatic, Buccal, Marginal, Cervical)
  5. Core components: SVE (motor), GVE (parasympathetic), SVA (taste), GSA (ear sensation)
  6. Nuclei: Facial motor, superior salivatory, solitary, spinal trigeminal
  7. Testing (OSCE): Raise eyebrows, close eyes, smile, puff cheeks, taste
  8. UMN vs LMN distinction (CRITICAL):
     - UMN: Forehead SPARED, lower face weak (contralateral) = stroke
     - LMN: BOTH upper+lower weak (ipsilateral) = Bell palsy or nerve injury
  9. Lesion localization by level:
     - Supranuclear: forehead sparing
     - CPA/IAM: hearing + facial weakness
     - Proximal facial canal: hyperacusis + taste loss + dryness
     - Distal to stapedius: taste loss, salivation loss, NO hyperacusis
     - Distal to stylomastoid: pure motor
  10. Pathologies: Bell palsy, Ramsay Hunt, crocodile tears, Frey syndrome
  11. CRITICAL DENTISTRY: Transient palsy after IAN block
      - Anesthetic in parotid → facial nerve block
      - Temporary; protect eye; prevent with correct technique
