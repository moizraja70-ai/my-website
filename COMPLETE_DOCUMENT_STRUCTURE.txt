SECTION 5: CN V - TRIGEMINAL NERVE (SUPER HIGH-YIELD)
Images: Images 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 (10 major anatomical figures)

Subsections:
  5.1 Why CN V is #1 dental nerve
    - Largest cranial nerve
    - Provides almost ALL general sensation from face, teeth, gingiva, oral mucosa
    - Motor supply to muscles of mastication
    - Carries parasympathetic fibers to lacrimal + salivary glands

  5.2 Anatomy Overview (Image 4-5)
    - Arises from lateral pons
    - Large sensory root → trigeminal ganglion (Meckel's cave)
    - Small motor root → joins V3 only
    - Three divisions: V1 (Ophthalmic), V2 (Maxillary), V3 (Mandibular)

  5.3 Divisions & Foramina (Image 6)
    - V1: Superior orbital fissure (pure sensory)
    - V2: Foramen rotundum (pure sensory)
    - V3: Foramen ovale (mixed: sensory + motor)

  5.4 Cutaneous Sensory Distribution (Images 7-8)
    - V1: Cornea, upper eyelid, forehead, dorsum of nose
    - V2: Maxillary teeth, palate, upper lip, lateral nose
    - V3: Mandibular teeth, lower lip/chin, anterior 2/3 tongue (general), buccal mucosa

  5.5 Trigeminal Sensory Nuclei
    - Mesencephalic nucleus (midbrain): proprioception from mastication muscles, TMJ, PDL
    - Principal (chief) sensory nucleus (pons): fine touch + vibration
    - Spinal trigeminal nucleus (pons→medulla→upper cervical): pain + temperature
    - Trigeminal motor nucleus (pons): motor to 1st pharyngeal arch muscles

  5.6 V2 (Maxillary) Dental Branches
    - Posterior superior alveolar (PSA): maxillary molars, buccal gingiva, sinus mucosa
    - Middle superior alveolar (MSA): premolars, sometimes MB root of 1st molar
    - Anterior superior alveolar (ASA): incisors + canines
    - Greater palatine: hard palate + palatal gingiva of posterior teeth
    - Nasopalatine: anterior hard palate (canine-to-canine)

  5.7 V3 (Mandibular) Dental Branches
    - Inferior alveolar nerve (IAN): all mandibular teeth via mandibular foramen→mandibular canal
    - Mental nerve: lower lip, chin, labial gingiva anterior region
    - Incisive nerve: anterior teeth region (intra-bony)
    - Long buccal nerve: buccal mucosa + gingiva of mandibular molars
    - Lingual nerve: GENERAL sensation anterior 2/3 tongue, floor of mouth, lingual gingiva
    - Motor: muscles of mastication, mylohyoid, anterior belly digastric, tensor veli palatini

  5.8 Parasympathetic "Hitchhiking" (Images 9-10 context)
    Text describes how PS fibers from other nerves travel on CN V:
    - Lacrimal gland: CN VII (greater petrosal) → pterygopalatine ganglion → joins V2 (zygomatic)
    - Submandibular/sublingual glands: CN VII (chorda tympani) joins V3 (lingual) → submandibular ganglion
    - Parotid gland: CN IX → otic ganglion → rides on V3 (auriculotemporal)
    - Dentistry clincher: Lingual nerve injury affects BOTH sensation (V3) + taste/salivation (VII)

  5.9 Trigeminal Sensory "Onion-Skin" Distribution (Image 12)
    - Pain/temperature distribution from spinal trigeminal nucleus
    - Central lesions produce "onion-skin" loss of pain/temperature on face
    - Classic clue in lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome

  5.10 Reflexes Involving CN V (Image 13 - Corneal reflex arc)
    - Corneal reflex: V1 afferent (nasociliary) → VII efferent (orbicularis oculi)
    - Jaw jerk: V3 proprioception afferent (mesencephalic) → V3 motor efferent (masseter)
    - Sneezing: V1/V2 afferent → multiple efferent

  5.11 Local Anesthesia Nerve Blocks (SUPER HIGH-YIELD DENTISTRY)
    Table with comprehensive block information:

    BLOCK 1: Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block (IANB)
    - Nerve: Inferior alveolar nerve (V3) ± lingual
    - Landmark: Needle near mandibular foramen (pterygomandibular space) just above occlusal plane
    - Area anesthetized: Mandibular teeth on that side; often lingual soft tissue if lingual affected
    - Complications: Failure (high variability), intravascular injection, hematoma, trismus, facial nerve palsy if in parotid

    BLOCK 2: Long Buccal Nerve Block
    - Nerve: Long buccal nerve (V3)
    - Landmark: Mucobuccal fold distal/buccal to last molar
    - Area: Buccal mucosa + buccal gingiva of mandibular molars
    - Complications: Easy to miss—patient feels gingival pain during extraction

    BLOCK 3: Mental/Incisive Block
    - Nerve: Mental nerve / Incisive nerve (V3)
    - Landmark: Infiltrate near mental foramen (premolar region)
    - Area: Lower lip + chin; anterior teeth (incisive) WITHOUT lingual soft tissue
    - Complications: Do NOT numb molars; foramen position varies

    BLOCK 4: Gow-Gates Block
    - Nerve: V3 trunk
    - Landmark: Neck of mandibular condyle (higher block)
    - Area: Most of V3 distribution (IAN, lingual, buccal, auriculotemporal)
    - Complications: Slower onset, requires mouth wide open, technique-sensitive

    BLOCK 5: Akinosi (Closed-Mouth) Block
    - Nerve: V3 (IAN/lingual)
    - Landmark: Needle in pterygomandibular space with mouth closed
    - Area: Useful in trismus; similar to IANB outcomes
    - Complications: Landmarks less obvious; risk of over/under-insertion

    BLOCK 6: Infraorbital Block
    - Nerve: Infraorbital nerve (V2) → ASA/MSA
    - Landmark: Palpate infraorbital foramen; inject in mucobuccal fold above premolars
    - Area: Upper lip, lateral nose, lower eyelid; anterior/premolar teeth (variable)
    - Complications: Hematoma, avoid piercing orbit, foramen palpation important

    BLOCK 7: Posterior Superior Alveolar (PSA) Block
    - Nerve: PSA nerve (V2)
    - Landmark: Posterior maxilla near maxillary tuberosity
    - Area: Maxillary molars + buccal gingiva (posterior)
    - Complications: Hematoma (pterygoid plexus), aspiration essential

    BLOCK 8: Greater Palatine Block
    - Nerve: Greater palatine nerve (V2)
    - Landmark: Greater palatine foramen (near 2nd molar region)
    - Area: Posterior hard palate + palatal mucosa/gingiva
    - Complications: Painful injection, blanching helps, avoid artery injury

    BLOCK 9: Nasopalatine Block
    - Nerve: Nasopalatine nerve (V2)
    - Landmark: Incisive papilla region
    - Area: Anterior hard palate (canine-to-canine)
    - Complications: Very painful—use topical + pressure anesthesia

    Exam Tip: Always answer blocks as 'nerve + area anesthetized + landmark + complication'
    Key Principle: For maxilla, infiltration works well because bone is porous (except dense cortical areas)

  5.12 Common Trigeminal Pathologies
    - Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux): sudden, severe, electric-shock facial pain in V2/V3; trigger zones
    - Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy: after extraction/implant/fractures → numbness/paresthesia
    - Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (V1): painful vesicular rash + corneal risk
    - Cavernous sinus syndrome: V1/V2 sensory loss + ocular motor palsies + proptosis
    - TMD and myofascial pain: V3 motor + sensory involvement

SECTION 6: CN VII - FACIAL NERVE (VERY HIGH-YIELD)
Images: Images 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (5 major anatomical figures)

Subsections:
  6.1 What CN VII Does
    - Motor to facial expression + stapedius
    - Parasympathetic to lacrimal + submandibular/sublingual salivary glands
    - Taste from anterior 2/3 tongue

  6.2 Facial Nerve Course Complete (Image 14 - comprehensive diagram)
    - Leaves brainstem at pontomedullary junction (cerebellopontine angle)
    - Enters internal acoustic meatus with CN VIII
    - Travels through facial canal (temporal bone)
    - Geniculate ganglion: sensory ganglion (taste + somatic)
    - Branches within facial canal:
      * Greater petrosal nerve → pterygopalatine ganglion → lacrimal + nasal/palatal glands
      * Nerve to stapedius → dampens loud sound
      * Chorda tympani → joins lingual nerve (V3) → taste anterior 2/3 + PS to submandibular/sublingual
    - Exits via stylomastoid foramen
    - Branches: posterior auricular, stylohyoid, posterior belly digastric
    - Enters parotid gland (does NOT supply parotid secretion - that's CN IX)
    - Forms parotid plexus → divides into 5 terminal branches

  6.3 Facial Nerve in Temporal Bone (Image 15)
    - Schematic showing path through temporal bone

  6.4 Parotid Plexus & Terminal Branches (Image 16)
    - Mnemonic: To Zanzibar By Motor Car
    - Temporal branch
    - Zygomatic branch
    - Buccal branch
    - Marginal mandibular branch (most at risk in mandibular angle/submandibular surgery)
    - Cervical branch

  6.5 Facial Nerve Dissection (Image 17 - real anatomy photo)
    - Practical visual reference for anatomical relationships

  6.6 Core CN VII Components (4 functional types)
    1. SVE (motor): muscles of facial expression, stapedius, stylohyoid, posterior belly digastric
    2. GVE (parasympathetic): lacrimal gland, nasal/palatal glands, submandibular/sublingual
    3. SVA (taste): anterior 2/3 of tongue via chorda tympani
    4. GSA (small): skin of external ear/meatus

  6.7 CN VII Nuclei (High Yield)
    - Facial motor nucleus (pons) → motor fibers (SVE)
    - Superior salivatory nucleus (pons) → parasympathetic fibers (GVE)
    - Solitary nucleus (upper part) → taste fibers (SVA)
    - Spinal trigeminal nucleus → somatic sensation from ear (GSA)

  6.8 Testing CN VII (OSCE)
    - Inspect face at rest: asymmetry, flattening of nasolabial fold, drooling
    - Raise eyebrows (frontalis)
    - Close eyes tightly (orbicularis oculi) — try to open them
    - Smile / show teeth (zygomaticus)
    - Puff cheeks (buccinator) — look for air leak
    - Optional: taste test (anterior tongue) + lacrimation
    - Corneal reflex: V1 afferent, VII efferent

  6.9 UMN vs LMN Facial Palsy (Image 18 - key comparison diagram)
    UMN facial palsy:
    - Forehead SPARED (receives bilateral cortical input)
    - Contralateral LOWER facial weakness
    - Think stroke; check limb signs

    LMN facial palsy:
    - Ipsilateral weakness of BOTH upper + lower face
    - From facial nerve itself (Bell palsy, parotid injury, etc.)

  6.10 Facial Nerve Lesion Localization (By symptom level)

    LEVEL 1: Supranuclear (UMN)
    - Key findings: Contralateral LOWER face weakness; forehead spared
    - Why: Bilateral innervation of forehead
    - Dentistry note: Think stroke; check limb signs

    LEVEL 2: CPA / Internal Acoustic Meatus
    - Key findings: Facial weakness + hearing symptoms
    - Why: VII travels with VIII (vestibular schwannoma can compress both)
    - Dentistry note: Cerebellopontine angle pathology

    LEVEL 3: Proximal in Facial Canal (Before greater petrosal)
    - Key findings: Facial weakness + dry eye + loss of taste + hyperacusis
    - Why: Greater petrosal, chorda tympani, stapedius ALL affected
    - Dentistry note: Temporal bone pathology

    LEVEL 4: Between Nerve to Stapedius and Chorda Tympani
    - Key findings: Facial weakness + loss of taste/salivation; NO hyperacusis
    - Why: Stapedius spared; chorda affected
    - Dentistry note: Taste complaint common

    LEVEL 5: Distal to Stylomastoid Foramen
    - Key findings: Pure motor facial weakness
    - Why: Branches to taste/PS already left
    - Dentistry note: Parotid surgery/trauma

  6.11 Important CN VII Pathologies
    - Bell palsy (idiopathic LMN): sudden unilateral weakness + ear pain; steroids often used
    - Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus): LMN palsy + painful ear vesicles ± hearing/vertigo
    - Parotid tumor/surgery injury: branch-dependent weakness
    - Temporal bone fractures / otitis media: can injure facial nerve in canal
    - Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): misrouting → tearing while eating
    - Frey syndrome (gustatory sweating): sweating/flushing while eating after parotid surgery

  6.12 CRITICAL DENTISTRY: Transient Facial Nerve Palsy After IAN Block
    Classic scenario:
    - Immediately after inferior alveolar block, patient cannot close eye + drooping mouth on that side
    - Cause: Anesthetic accidentally deposited into parotid gland
    - Result: Blocks facial nerve AFTER it exits stylomastoid foramen
    - Outcome: Usually temporary; protect eye until function returns
    - Prevention tips:
      * Correct landmarking (needle should not be too posterior)
      * Maintain contact with bone before depositing anesthetic
      * Aspirate to avoid intravascular injection

SECTION 7: INTEGRATION FOR DENTISTRY - HIGH-YIELD CLINICAL PATTERNS

Subsection A: Common Nerve Injuries in Dental Practice

TABLE: DENTAL NERVE INJURIES
  Row 1: Inferior alveolar nerve (V3)
    - Common dental cause: Mandibular third molar surgery, implants, fractures
    - Clinical presentation: Numbness/paresthesia of lower teeth, lower lip/chin (mental distribution)
    - Management: Document neurosensory exam; reassure if transient; refer if persistent

  Row 2: Lingual nerve (V3) + chorda tympani (VII)
    - Common dental cause: Third molar surgery, floor-of-mouth procedures
    - Clinical presentation: Numbness of anterior tongue/floor + possible loss of taste + reduced salivation
    - Management: Taste symptoms suggest chorda involvement; early referral if severe

  Row 3: Mental nerve (V3)
    - Common dental cause: Incisions near mental foramen, implants in premolar region
    - Clinical presentation: Numbness lower lip/chin
    - Management: Know mental foramen variability; careful flap design

  Row 4: Infraorbital nerve (V2)
    - Common dental cause: Zygomaticomaxillary fractures, surgery in canine fossa
    - Clinical presentation: Numbness of upper lip/cheek, lateral nose
    - Management: Check sensation pre- and post-op

  Row 5: Facial nerve branches (VII)
    - Common dental cause: Parotid surgery; mandibular angle/submandibular incision
    - Clinical presentation: Asymmetry of smile, inability to pucker, drooling (branch-dependent)
    - Management: Marginal mandibular branch at risk; counsel patient

Subsection B: Referred Pain Patterns (Why toothache may not be dental)
  - Trigeminal system convergence → pain from TMJ, muscles, sinuses, or neuralgias perceived as tooth pain
  - Maxillary sinusitis → upper posterior tooth pain (V2; PSA/MSA area)
  - Myofascial pain (masseter/temporalis) → molar pain-like symptoms (V3 motor/sensory region)
  - Glossopharyngeal neuralgia → throat/tonsil pain radiating to ear; can confuse diagnosis

Subsection C: Mini Clinical Cases (Viva Style)

  Case 1: Absent Corneal Reflex
  - Stem: Patient has absent corneal reflex on right. On touching right cornea, there is no blink in either eye
  - Key answer points:
    * Likely afferent problem: right V1 (nasociliary) sensory loss
    * Efferent VII is intact because left cornea stimulation should still blink both eyes

  Case 2: Transient Facial Palsy After IAN Block
  - Stem: After IAN block, patient cannot close right eye and mouth droops immediately
  - Key answer points:
    * Likely facial nerve anesthesia from inadvertent parotid injection
    * Temporary; protect eye; reassure; prevent by correct technique

  Case 3: Electric Shock Pain in V2
  - Stem: Severe electric shock pain in V2 region triggered by brushing teeth; neuro exam normal
  - Key answer points:
    * Trigeminal neuralgia likely
    * Important to avoid unnecessary endodontic/extraction; refer for medical therapy

Subsection D: SBA/MCQ-Style Stems (with Key Answers)
  - Corneal reflex afferent limb is: Nasociliary nerve (V1)
  - Loss of taste from anterior 2/3 tongue suggests: Chorda tympani (CN VII)
  - UMN facial palsy typically shows: Forehead sparing + contralateral lower face weakness
  - Parotid secretion parasympathetic supply: Auriculotemporal nerve (V3) after otic ganglion synapse (CN IX origin)
  - Pain and temperature from face synapse in: Spinal trigeminal nucleus
  - Hyperacusis in facial nerve lesion suggests: Involvement proximal to nerve to stapedius branch
  - Parotid tail and tragus innervation: Great auricular nerve (C2, C3) + other branches
