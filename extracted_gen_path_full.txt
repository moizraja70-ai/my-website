CHAPTER 1: CELLULAR REACTION TO INJURY
🔬 OVERVIEW
Definition: Cellular reaction to injury encompasses all the morphologic and functional changes that cells undergo when exposed to stress or noxious stimuli.
Clinical Importance: Understanding cell injury is fundamental to pathology as it explains the basis of all disease processes. Recognizing reversible vs irreversible injury helps determine treatment windows.
I. ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS
A. Hypertrophy
Increase in size of organ/tissue due to increase in cell SIZE (not number)
↑ Protein synthesis and ↑ size/number of intracellular organelles
Examples: Skeletal muscle with exercise, Left ventricle in hypertension
KEY POINT: Result of increased WORKLOAD
B. Hyperplasia
Increase in organ/tissue size due to increase in cell NUMBER
Examples: Glandular proliferation in breast during pregnancy
Often occurs TOGETHER with hypertrophy (e.g., uterus in pregnancy)
KEY POINT: Only cells capable of division can undergo hyperplasia
C. Aplasia
FAILURE of cell production
Fetal development: Results in AGENESIS (absence of organ)
Later in life: Caused by permanent loss of precursor cells (e.g., bone marrow)
D. Hypoplasia
DECREASE in cell production (less extreme than aplasia)
Examples: Partial lack of gonadal growth in Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome
E. Atrophy
Decrease in organ/tissue size due to decrease in mass of PREEXISTING cells
Causes: Disuse, nutritional/oxygen deprivation, ↓ endocrine stimulation, aging, denervation
Features: Autophagic granules (vacuoles with debris from degraded organelles)
Mechanism: Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation
F. Metaplasia
Definition: Replacement of one differentiated tissue by another
Types:
1. Squamous Metaplasia:
Columnar → Squamous epithelium
Sites: Cervix (squamocolumnar junction), Bronchus, Endometrium, Pancreatic ducts
Causes: Chronic irritation (tobacco), Vitamin A deficiency
KEY POINT: Often REVERSIBLE
2. Osseous Metaplasia:
Formation of NEW BONE at sites of tissue injury
Cartilaginous metaplasia may also occur
3. Myeloid Metaplasia (Extramedullary Hematopoiesis):
Proliferation of hematopoietic tissue at sites OTHER than bone marrow
Sites: Liver, Spleen
II. HYPOXIC CELL INJURY
A. Causes of Hypoxia
ISCHEMIA (most common) - obstruction of arterial blood flow
ANEMIA - reduction in oxygen-carrying RBCs
CARBON MONOXIDE poisoning - ↓ oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin
DECREASED PERFUSION - cardiac failure, hypotension, shock
POOR OXYGENATION - pulmonary disease
B. Early Stage (REVERSIBLE)
First affected: MITOCHONDRIA → ↓ oxidative phosphorylation → ↓ ATP synthesis
Consequences of ↓ ATP:
Cell membrane pump FAILURE (Na+-K+-ATPase) → ↑ intracellular Na+ and water, ↓ K+
   - Results in CELLULAR SWELLING (hydropic change)
   - Endoplasmic reticulum swelling (first ultrastructural change)
   - Mitochondrial swelling (reversible → irreversible)
RIBOSOME DISAGGREGATION → failure of protein synthesis
↑ GLYCOLYSIS → lactate accumulation → ↓ pH → chromatin clumping
C. Late Stage
MEMBRANE DAMAGE to plasma and organelle membranes
Reversible signs: Myelin figures (whorl-like structures), Cell blebs (surface deformity)
D. Cell Death (IRREVERSIBLE)
POINT OF NO RETURN: Irreversible membrane damage → massive CALCIUM INFLUX
Extensive mitochondrial calcification
Intracellular enzymes released into circulation (basis of lab tests)
💡 HIGH-YIELD: Cardiac enzymes (LDH, CK, troponin) are released due to membrane damage in myocardial necrosis
III. FREE RADICAL INJURY
A. Definition
Free radicals: Chemical species with unpaired electrons that damage cells by lipid peroxidation, cross-linking proteins, and DNA fragmentation
B. Sources

Chemicals and drugs
Reperfusion injury
C. Mechanisms of Damage

CATALASE: Converts H2O2 to water
GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE: Removes H2O2
VITAMINS E and C: Antioxidants
IV. CHEMICAL CELL INJURY
Direct toxicity to cellular components
Conversion to toxic metabolites (e.g., CCl4 → CCl3 free radical)
Examples: Acetaminophen (liver), Carbon tetrachloride
V. NECROSIS
A. Definition
Necrosis: Morphologic changes that follow cell death in living tissue; involves enzymatic digestion of dead cells
B. Types of Necrosis
1. COAGULATIVE NECROSIS:
Most common type
Due to ISCHEMIA in most organs (EXCEPT brain)
Preservation of cell OUTLINE (ghost cells)
Increased eosinophilia (loss of RNA/DNA)
Examples: Myocardial infarction, Renal infarction
2. LIQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS:
Tissue transformed into viscous liquid
CNS ischemia (brain infarction)
Suppurative infections (abscess formation)
Due to rich lipid content and lack of structural framework
3. CASEOUS NECROSIS:
Cheese-like (caseous) appearance
Characteristic of TUBERCULOSIS
Amorphous, eosinophilic debris
Associated with granulomatous inflammation
4. FAT NECROSIS:
Specific to adipose tissue
Mechanisms:
   a) Enzymatic (pancreatitis) - lipase releases fatty acids → calcium soaps (SAPONIFICATION)
   b) Traumatic (breast) - direct injury to fat
Chalky white appearance due to calcium deposits
Can be visualized on X-ray
5. FIBRINOID NECROSIS:
Immune-mediated vascular damage
Deposition of IMMUNE COMPLEXES and fibrin in vessel walls
Brightly eosinophilic ("fibrin-like")
Examples: Polyarteritis nodosa, Malignant hypertension
C. Nuclear Changes in Necrosis

Cytochrome c release → caspase activation
p53 promotes apoptosis by transcription of bax gene
2. Extrinsic (Death Receptor) Pathway:
Triggered by Fas ligand and TNF
Fas-Fas ligand interaction important in immune regulation
Direct caspase activation
💡 HIGH-YIELD: Caspases are proteases that execute apoptosis. bcl-2 is anti-apoptotic; bax is pro-apoptotic
VII. REVERSIBLE CELLULAR CHANGES AND ACCUMULATIONS
A. Cellular Swelling (Hydropic Change)
First manifestation of cell injury

BENIGN: Non-cancerous, well-differentiated, non-invasive, no metastasis
MALIGNANT: Cancerous, may be poorly differentiated, invasive, metastasizes
METASTASIS: Spread to distant sites (hallmark of malignancy)
DYSPLASIA: Disordered growth, pre-neoplastic (may be reversible)
CARCINOMA IN SITU: Full-thickness dysplasia without basement membrane invasion
B. Nomenclature
BENIGN TUMORS:
   - Add -oma to cell type
   - Adenoma (glandular), Lipoma (fat), Fibroma (fibrous)

   - Based on: Nuclear pleomorphism, Mitotic rate, Necrosis
STAGING: Extent of spread (anatomic)
   - TNM system:
       • T: Tumor size/local extent (T0-T4)
       • N: Node involvement (N0-N3)
       • M: Metastasis (M0, M1)

📚 COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL PATHOLOGY SUMMARY
HIGH-YIELD CONCEPTS FOR EXAMS
CELL INJURY:
   • Hypoxia affects MITOCHONDRIA first → ↓ ATP → pump failure
   • REVERSIBLE: ER swelling, myelin figures, cell blebs
   • IRREVERSIBLE: Membrane damage, calcium influx, nuclear changes

   • Liquefactive = brain, abscesses; Caseous = TB; Fat = pancreas
INFLAMMATION:
   • Cardinal signs: Rubor, Dolor, Calor, Tumor, Functio laesa
   • Selectins = ROLLING; Integrins = FIRM ADHESION
   • Neutrophils first 24h; Macrophages after 2-3 days
   • C5a and LTB4 = potent chemoattractants
   • Granuloma = epithelioid macrophages + lymphocytes
   • Type I = IgE; Type II = Anti-cell; Type III = Complexes; Type IV = T cells
HEMODYNAMICS:
   • Virchow Triad: Endothelial injury, Stasis, Hypercoagulability
   • Factor V Leiden = most common hereditary thrombophilia
   • PE = DVT from legs; Systemic emboli = left heart

   • Shock types: Hypovolemic, Cardiogenic, Septic (most common in ICU)
GENETICS:
   • Down syndrome: 47,+21; Turner: 45,X; Klinefelter: 47,XXY
   • CF: CFTR ΔF508; ↑ sweat chloride; lung infections
   • Sickle cell: Glu6Val; malaria resistance in heterozygotes
   • Mitochondrial inheritance: MATERNAL only
IMMUNOLOGY:
   • CD4:CD8 ratio = 2:1 (reversed in AIDS)
   • C3b = opsonization; C5a = chemotaxis

   • CGD: Defective NADPH oxidase, catalase+ organisms
   • SLE: ANA+, anti-dsDNA, immune complex nephritis
NEOPLASIA:
   • Metastasis = hallmark of malignancy
   • Oncogenes: ras (25-30%), bcr-abl (CML), HER-2/neu (breast)
   • Tumor suppressors: p53 (>50%), Rb, APC, BRCA1/2
   • HPV E6 inhibits p53; E7 inhibits Rb
   • Grading = differentiation; Staging = extent (TNM)
ENVIRONMENTAL:
   • Alcohol: Fatty change → Hepatitis → Cirrhosis
   • CO binds Hb 200x > O2; Cyanide inhibits cytochrome oxidase
   • Lead: Basophilic stippling, wrist drop, Burton line
   • Acetaminophen: Treat with N-acetylcysteine
NUTRITION:
   • Vitamin A: Night blindness (early), keratomalacia (blindness)
