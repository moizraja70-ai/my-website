SECTION B: EPIDEMIOLOGY
================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION TO EPIDEMIOLOGY

Definition by John M Last:
Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems.

Components:
- Distribution: Analysis by time, place, and person
- Determinants: Factors influencing disease (host, agent, environment)
- Application: Using findings for prevention and control

2. DEFINITIONS

HEALTH (WHO 1948):
A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

Dimensions of Health:
1. Physical dimension: Perfect functioning of body
2. Mental dimension: State of balance with surroundings
3. Social dimension: Quality of interpersonal ties
4. Spiritual dimension: Ethics, purpose in life
5. Emotional dimension: Feeling and cognition

DISEASE:
A pathological condition with identifiable signs and symptoms resulting from causes like infection, genetics, or environment.

Types:
- Endemic: Constant presence in geographic area
- Epidemic: More cases than expected
- Pandemic: Spread across countries/continents

3. CHAIN OF INFECTION

Three essential links:

LINK 1: RESERVOIR
Definition: Any person, animal, plant, or substance where infectious agent lives

Types:
- Human Reservoir: Most important (cases or carriers)
  * Cases: Persons with disease
  * Carriers: Infected but asymptomatic
    - Incubatory carrier: Sheds during incubation
    - Convalescent carrier: Sheds during recovery
    - Healthy carrier: Never develops disease
    - Chronic carrier: Sheds for months/years

- Animal Reservoir: Zoonotic diseases (rabies, yellow fever)
- Non-living Reservoir: Soil (tetanus, anthrax)

LINK 2: MODE OF TRANSMISSION

A. Direct Transmission:
- Direct contact: STDs, AIDS, leprosy
- Droplet infection: Diphtheria, TB, meningitis (<1m range)
- Contact with soil: Hookworm, tetanus
- Inoculation: Rabies (bite), Hepatitis B (needle)
- Transplacental: TORCH infections

B. Indirect Transmission (5 Fs):
- Vehicle-borne: Water, food (cholera, typhoid)
- Vector-borne: Arthropods (malaria)
- Air-borne: Droplet nuclei (TB, measles)
- Fomite-borne: Contaminated objects
- Unclean hands: Most common mode

LINK 3: SUSCEPTIBLE HOST
Factors affecting susceptibility:
- Age: Very young and elderly more susceptible
- Immune status: Immunocompromised individuals
- Nutritional status: Malnutrition reduces immunity
- Heredity: Genetic predisposition

4. STAGES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE

1. Incubation Period: Time from invasion to first symptom
2. Prodromal Stage: Initial nonspecific symptoms
3. Period of Illness: Disease fully developed
4. Period of Decline: Symptoms fading
5. Convalescence: Recovery period

5. IMMUNITY

ACTIVE IMMUNITY:
- Definition: Body produces own antibodies
- Duration: Long-lasting (months to lifetime)
- Types:
  * Natural: Following infection
  * Artificial: Through vaccination

PASSIVE IMMUNITY:
- Definition: Ready-made antibodies transferred
- Duration: Temporary (weeks to months)
- Types:
  * Natural: Maternal antibodies
  * Artificial: Immunoglobulins

Types of Immunoglobulins:
- Normal human Ig: Pool of 1000+ donors (measles, Hep A)
- Specific human Ig: High antibody content (Hep B, rabies)
- Antisera: Animal-derived (tetanus, snake bite)

6. SCREENING

Definition: Presumptive identification of unrecognized disease

Wilson and Jungner Criteria:
1. Condition is important health problem
2. Accepted treatment available
3. Diagnostic facilities available
4. Recognizable latent/early stage
5. Suitable screening test

================================================================================
SECTION E: PREVENTIVE DENTISTRY
================================================================================

1. LEVELS OF PREVENTION

- Action before disease onset
- Examples: Health education, immunization, fluoride

Secondary Prevention:
- Early diagnosis and prompt treatment
- Examples: Screening, early caries detection

Tertiary Prevention:
- Disability limitation and rehabilitation
- Examples: Prosthetic rehabilitation

2. FLUORIDES IN CARIES PREVENTION

A. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

- 1874: German physician Carl Erhardt first mentioned fluoride
- 1901: Frederick McKay observed mottled enamel in Colorado
- 1916: G.V. Black and McKay described mottled enamel
- 1931: Alcoa chemist Churchill identified fluoride as cause
- 1938: Dean established relationship between fluoride and caries reduction
- 1945: Grand Rapids-Michigan first artificial fluoridation study

Dean's 21-City Study (1942):
- Showed inverse relationship between fluoride in water and caries
- 1 ppm F = 50-60% caries reduction
- No significant fluorosis at 1 ppm

B. NATURAL OCCURRENCE OF FLUORIDE

Fluorine:
- Atomic number: 9
- Atomic weight: 19
- Lightest halogen
- Most electronegative element

Sources:
- Minerals: Fluorspar (CaF2), Cryolite (Na3AlF6), Fluorapatite
- Water: Varies by geographic area
- Food: Fish, tea, bones

Distribution in Body:
- Bones and teeth accumulate fluoride
- Cementum has highest concentration
- Fluoride increases with age in hard tissues
- Rapid excretion through kidneys

C. SYSTEMIC FLUORIDES

Definition: Fluoride ingested and incorporated during tooth development

Methods:
1. Water Fluoridation
   - Optimal level: 0.7-1.2 ppm (climate dependent)
   - Reduction in caries: 50-65%
   - Most cost-effective public health measure

2. Salt Fluoridation
   - Common in Europe
   - 200-250 mg F per kg salt

3. Milk Fluoridation
   - Alternative where water not feasible
   - Part of school feeding programs

4. Fluoride Supplements
   - Tablets, drops, lozenges
   - Dosage based on age and water fluoride level

Mechanism of Systemic Fluoride:
- Pre-eruptive: Incorporation into developing enamel
- Makes enamel more acid-resistant
- Alters tooth morphology (shallow fissures)
- Enhances mineralization

D. TOPICAL FLUORIDES

Definition: Fluoride applied directly to tooth surfaces

Professional Application:

1. Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride (APF)
   - 1.23% F (12,300 ppm)
   - pH 3.5
   - Solution or gel
   - 4-minute application
   - Not for children (erosion risk)

2. Neutral Sodium Fluoride (NaF)
   - 2% solution (9,000 ppm)
   - 5% varnish
   - Safe for all ages

3. Stannous Fluoride (SnF2)
   - 8% solution
   - May cause staining
   - Bitter taste

4. Fluoride Varnish
   - 2.26% F (Duraphat)
   - 5% NaF
   - Adheres to teeth
   - Slow release

Self-Applied:

1. Fluoride Toothpastes
   - Adult: 1000-1500 ppm
   - Children: 500 ppm
   - Most widely used fluoride method

2. Fluoride Mouth Rinses
   - Daily: 0.05% NaF (225 ppm)
   - Weekly: 0.2% NaF (900 ppm)
   - School programs

Mechanism of Topical Fluoride:
- Enhances remineralization
- Inhibits demineralization
- Inhibits bacterial metabolism
- Incorporates into enamel as fluorapatite

E. TOXICITY OF FLUORIDE

Acute Toxicity:
- Certainly Lethal Dose (CLD): 32-64 mg/kg
