Foreword
he problems related to oral health are often overlooked
by the community primarily because these are usually
not life-threatening conditions. One of the reasons for
this attitude towards oral health neglect is the poor
representation of dentists to the community and 
vice versa.
Several efforts have been persistently made in India by
governing and statutory bodies like the Dental Council of
India, Indian Dental Association and particularly the Indian Association of
Public Health Dentistry, and several players in the field of dentistry to bridge
the chasm between dental service delivery and the community. A peep into
the past will remind us of the untiring works of several stalwarts. May I,
infact dedicate this ode to Dr. Mohandas Bhat and Mr Orango who have been
pioneers with their vision and efforts to start the first department of
community dentistry (in 1971) at Government Dental College, Bangalore. I
laud the efforts of one and all including Dr. Joseph John who has over the
past decade worked relentlessly to set the bar higher and make community
and public health dentistry more visible than what it was several decades ago
by his contributions including the past edition of the book in context.
The need to emphasize on this specialty right in the formative years of
dental graduates is obvious. It has been said, “A journey of thousand miles
begins with first step”. This book on public health dentistry does just that is
to place the right first step within the protocol of the undergraduate
curriculum.
Additionally, the author identifies the fact that the addressal of issues (in
dentistry) in our Indian subcontinent requires a different perspective when
compared to the rest of the world. This may be attributed to shifting
demographic status, evolving economic trends, changing dental services and
newer policies attributed to health care. This constant state of flux makes it a
herculean task to perform. Yet this task has been carried out flawlessly by the
ardent specialty of public health dentistry. May we rightly say this specialty

=== PAGE 8 ===
is the “guardian of dentistry” in all aspects? In truth of the aforementioned
statement, it can also be said that this book is the pole star to attain the same
effect.
Apart from drafting policies and administering tasks to meet the unmet
needs of people, the game changers in this field of public health dentistry are
also sharing the onus to align the education in dentistry, in laying down the
principles and guidelines of ethics in dentistry, coming up with solutions of
insurance and payment policies, defining the legalities of duty, demystifying
the enigma of infection control and sterilization policies and much more—
primarily to append the existing status of dental research and practice. For the
undergraduates, the current edition of this book can be considered an
essential elemental documentation, converged in a lucid manner not only
nuance of the subject but also cultivate in them a sense of responsibility
towards serving the public in a disciplined, assertive and dogmatic manner.
An interesting aspect of this book is that even for those of us who belong
to a specialty other than community dentistry (like me) find this book
elucidative and enlightening about several issues.
As is said, the ‘loftier the building, the deeper must its foundation be
laid’. If we wish to raise dentistry on a still higher pedestal, we need to ensure
our future generation is made robust and endowed. This edition does just that
it passes the legacy to the younger generation in a simplistic and
comprehensive manner and empowers them to put India on a global map in
the field of dentistry!
Kudos and read on ...!

Preface to the Third Edition
t has been a pleasure to work on the third edition of 
Textbook of Preventive
and Community Dentistry
 because it has presented me an opportunity to
provide a framework for students to learn the subject and bring into focus
some of the newer concepts in preventive dentistry. Much of the materials in
several chapters have been completely rewritten or revised by selected
contributors from their areas of expertise. In writing the third edition, I have
tried hard to be precise while at the same time being reader friendly. The
focus of the third edition of this book has not changed from previous editions.
I am, therefore, confident that the undergraduate students will find the book
useful.
As in the previous edition, the book has been divided into seven
sections:
Section A:
 This part presents fundamental aspects of public health and
a historical perspective of history of medicine, public health and its
practice with health education. A brief overview of health care delivery
system of India is also discussed.
Section B:
 Broadens understanding of the role of epidemiology,
linking it with other core public health disciplines, and highlighting the
core diseases in oral health which are of prime importance in the real-
world practice of public health.
Section C:
 Deals with infection control procedures and precautions
taken in health care settings to prevent the spread of disease. The
transmission of infection in a dental practice is one of the most serious
issues the industry can face, which is why it is so important that
everyone in the dental office be aware of the most recent protocols to
reduce the overall risk.
Section D:
 This section introduces the core principles of dental public

=== PAGE 12 ===
health, and its application to population-based oral health. Differences
in the roles of a private dental practitioner and a dental public health
specialist are addressed. The importance of core public health
functions, indices, planning of oral health status and payment to dental
care is highlighted.
Section E:
 The caries preventive mechanisms of fluoride, materials
and methods for rational use of fluorides for self-care and professional
along with minimally invasive procedures are highlighted in this
section.
Section F:
 This section on biostatistics is casual in tone and sometimes
a bit demanding where mathematical and statistical tests are
introduced. We have made an attempt to simplify statistical methods in
the best possible manner.
Section G:
 The last part of the section sits at the crossroads of health.
Social sciences are intimately connected to the health and
socioeconomic welfare of individuals, families, and communities. As a
result, efforts to improve oral health must consider both the
consequences and causes of underlying social, political, cultural and
economic factors that affect oral health.

Health, Disease
and Infection
Kindness, concern and love for the art of healing earned “
Hippocrates
” the
immortal title of “Father of Medicine”. Medicine has evolved after a series of
false theories, misinformation, mistaken interpretations, inventions and
discoveries. Medical knowledge in fact has been derived, to a very great
degree, from the intuitive and observational propositions and cumulative
experiences gleaned from others.

=== PAGE 26 ===
VARIOUS SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE
From time immemorial, man has been interested in trying to control the
disease. The medicine man, the priest, the herbolist and the magician, all
undertook in various ways to cure man’s disease and bring relief to the sick.

=== PAGE 27 ===
Medicine in Antiquity
Medicine was dominated by magical and religious beliefs, which were an
integral part of ancient culture and civilization. In ancient times, health and
illness were interpreted in a cosmological and anthropological perspectives.

=== PAGE 28 ===
Primitive Medicine
The primitive man attributed disease and in fact all human sufferings and
other calamities to the wrath of the gods, the invasion of body by “evil
spirits” and the influence of the stars and planets. The concept of disease in
which the ancient man believes is known as the “supernatural theories of
disease”. In the prehistoric times, medicine was intermingled with
superstition, religion, magic and witchcraft.

=== PAGE 29 ===
Indian Medicine
The medical systems those are truly Indian in origin and developments are
the Ayurveda and Siddha systems. Ayurveda is practiced throughout India,
but the Siddha system is practiced in the Tamil speaking areas of South India.
These systems differ very little in theory and practice. Ayurveda implies
“knowledge of life” or the knowledge by which life may be prolonged. Its
origin is traced back to Vedic times. During this period, the medical history
was associated with mythological figures, sages and seers. The celebrated
authorities in Ayurvedic medicine were Atreya, Charaka, Susruta and
Vaghbhatt. The Indian sago (rauwolfia) was employed for centuries by the
Indian physicians, before reserpine was extracted from the root and found
effective in the treatment of hypertension. Susruta was also called as the
“father of Indian surgery”. His work was mainly devoted to surgery, which
also included medicine, pathology, anatomy, midwifery, ophthalmology,
hygiene and bedside manners. The early Indians set fractures, performed
amputations, excised tumors, repaired hernias and excelled in cataract
operations and plastic surgeries. The golden age of Indian medicine was
between 800 BC and 600 AD. Other indigenous systems of medicine
practiced in India include Unani-Tibb and Homeopathy.

=== PAGE 30 ===
Chinese Medicine
Chinese medicine claims to be the world’s first organized body of medical
knowledge dating back to 2700 BC. Hygiene, dietetics, hydrotherapy,
massage, drugs were all used by Chinese physicians. Chinese were the early
pioneers of immunization. The Chinese systems of barefoot doctors and
acupuncture have attracted worldwide attention in recent years.

=== PAGE 31 ===
Egyptian Medicine
In Egyptian times, the art of medicine was mingled with religion. Egyptian
physicians were co-equals of priest, trained in schools within the temples.
They often helped priests to care for the sick who were brought to the
temples for treatment. Egyptian medicine was far from primitive. They
believed that pulse was the “speech of the heart”. Diseases were treated with
enema, bloodletting and wide range of drugs. In the field of public health
also, Egyptians excelled. They built planned cities, public baths, and
underground drains. They had also some knowledge of inoculation against
smallpox, the value of mosquito nets and the association of plague with rats.

=== PAGE 32 ===
Mesopotamian Medicine
The basic concepts of medicine were religious, and taught and practiced by
herb doctors and knife doctors and spell doctors—a classification that
roughly parallels our own internists, surgeons and psychiatrists. Medical
students were busy in classifying ‘demons’, the causes of the diseases. Laws
relating to medical practice including fees payable to the physicians for
satisfactory services and penalties for harmful therapy are contained in
Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the very first codification of medical
practice.

=== PAGE 33 ===
Greek Medicine
The Greeks enjoyed the reputation of “the civilizers of the ancient world”.
They taught men to think in terms of “why and how”. By far the greatest
physician in Greek medicine was Hippocrate who is called the ‘Father of
Medicine’. He studied and classified diseases based on observation and
reasoning. He challenged the tradition of magic in medicine, and initiated
radically new approach to the medicine, i.e. application of clinical methods in
medicine. Hippocratic concept of health and disease stressed the relation
between the man and the environment. In short, the Greeks gave a new
direction to medical thought. They rejected the supernatural theory of disease
and looked upon disease as a natural process, not a visitation from the God.
2

=== PAGE 34 ===
Roman Medicine
The Romans were more practical-minded people than the Greeks. They had a
keen sense of sanitation. Public health was born in Rome with the
development of baths, sewers and aqueducts. The Romans made fine roads,
throughout the empire, brought pure water to all the cities through aqueducts,
drained marshes to combat malaria, built seweage systems and established
hospitals for the sick. Galen was an outstanding figure among Roman
medical teachers. About the disease, Galen observed that disease is due to
three factors—predisposing, exciting and environmental factors.

=== PAGE 35 ===
HEALTH
All communities have their concepts of health, as part of their culture. Health
continues to be a neglected entity despite lip service. At the individual level,
it cannot be said that health occupies an important place, it is usually
subjugated to other needs defined as more important, e.g. power, prestige,
wealth, knowledge and security. Health is often taken for granted and its
value is not fully understood until it is lost.

=== PAGE 36 ===
Definition
Health is one of those terms, which most people find it difficult to define
although they are confident of its meaning. One of the oldest definitions of
health is “absence of disease”.
Webster defined health as “the condition of being sound in body, mind or
spirit, especially freedom from physical disease or pain”.
WHO defined as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-
being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity”.

Health has been viewed as an “absence of disease” and if one was free from
disease, then the person was considered healthy. This is known as the
biomedical concept. This concept was, however, found inadequate to solve
some of the major health problems like malnutrition, chronic diseases,
accidents, etc.
4f
2. Ecological Concept
The ecologists put forward a hypothesis, which viewed health as a dynamic
equilibrium between man and his environment, and disease a maladjustment
of the human organism to environment.
3. Psychosocial Concept
Health is influenced by social, psychological, cultural, economic and political
factors. These factors need to be considered while defining and measuring
health.
4. Holistic Concept
This concept implies that all sectors of society have an effect on health, in
particular agriculture, food, industry, education and other sectors. This view
corresponds to the view held by ancients that health implies a sound mind, in
a sound body, in a sound family, in a sound environment.

Dimensions of Health
Health is multidimensional. WHO envisages three specific dimensions,
namely the physical, mental and the social. The others include, spiritual,
emotional, vocational and political dimensions.
Physical Dimension
The state of physical health implies the notion of “perfect functioning” of the
body. It conceptualizes health biologically as a state in which every cell and
every organ is functioning at optimum capacity and in perfect harmony with
the rest of the body.
At the community level, such indicators, as death rate, infant mortality
rate and expectation of life, may assess the state of health.
Mental Dimension
Mental health is not mere absence of mental illness. Mental health is defined
as “a state of balance between the individual and the surrounding world, a
state of harmony between oneself and others, a coexistence between the
realities of the self and that of other people and that of the environment”.
Assessment of mental health at the population level may be made by
administering mental status questionnaires by trained interviewers.
Social Dimension
It has been defined as “quantity and quality of an individual’s interpersonal
ties and the extent of involvement with the community”.
Social well-being implies harmony and integration within the individual,
between each individual and other members of society and between
individuals and the world in which they live.
Spiritual Dimension
It includes integrity, principles and ethics, the purpose in life, commitment to
some higher being and belief in concepts that are not subject to “state of the
art” explanation.

Emotional Dimension
Mental and emotional dimensions have been seen as one element, however,
psychobiology relates emotional health, to “feeling” and mental health
towards “knowing” and “cognition”.
Others
A few other dimensions have also been suggested such as:
Vocational dimension
Philosophical dimension
Cultural dimension
Socioeconomic dimension
Environmental dimension
Educational dimension
Nutritional dimension
Preventive dimension.

Indicators of Health
Indicators are required not only to measure the health status of a community,
but also to compare the health status of one country with that of another, for
assessment of health care needs, for allocation of scarce resources, and for
monitoring and evaluation of health services, activities and programs.
Indicators help to measure the extent to which the objectives and the targets
of a program are being attained.
1
Characteristics of Indicators
Ideal indicators should be:
Valid
—should measure what they are supposed to measure.
Reliable
—answer should be the same when measured by different
people in similar circumstances.
Sensitive
—should be sensitive to the changes in the situation
concerned.
Specific
—should reflect changes only in the situation concerned.
Feasible
—should have the ability to obtain data needed.
Relevant
—should contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon
of interest.
Classification
The indicators of health may be classified as:
Mortality indicators
Morbidity indicators
Disability rates
Nutritional status indicators
Health care delivery indicators
Utilization rates
Indicators of social and mental health
Environmental indicators

1. Mortality Indicators
Crude death rate
: It is defined as number of deaths per 1000
population per year in a given community.
Expectation of life
:
 Life expectancy at birth is ‘the average number of
years that will be lived by those born alive into a population, if the
current age-specific mortality rate persists.
Infant mortality rate
:
 Infant mortality rate is the ratio of deaths under
1 year of age in a given year to the total number of live births in the
same year, usually expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.
Child mortality rate
:
 It is defined as the number of deaths at age 1–4
years in a given year per 1000 children in that age group at the
midpoint of the year concerned.
Under 5 proportionate mortality rate.
Maternal mortality rate.
Disease-specific mortality rate.
Proportional mortality rate.
2. Morbidity Indicators
The following morbidity rates are used for assessing ill health in community.
Incidence and prevalence.
Notification rates.
Attendance rates at out-patient departments, health centres, etc.
Admission, readmission and discharge rates.
Duration of stay in hospital.
Spells of sickness or absence from work or school.

expectancy the probable duration of bed disability and inability to perform
major activities, according to crosssectional data from the population surveys.
4. Nutritional Status Indicators
They are:
Anthropometric measurements of preschool children
Heights of children at school entry
Prevalence of low birth weight.
5. Health Care Delivery Indicators
The frequently used indicators are:
Doctor-population ratio.
Doctor-nurse ratio.
Population-bed ratio.
Population per health/subcentre.
Population per traditional birth attendant.
6. Utilization Rates
Utilization of services or actual coverage is expressed as the proportion of
people in need of a service who actually receive it in a given period, usually a
year.
7. Indicators of Social and Mental Health
These include suicide, homicide, other acts of violence and other crimes; road
traffic accidents, alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, consumption of
tranquilizers and obesity.

Environmental indicators reflect the quality of physical and biological
environment in which diseases occur and in which the people live. They
include pollution of water and air, radiation, solid wastes, noise, and exposure
to toxic substances in food and drink.
9. Socioeconomic Indicators
These include:
Rate of population increase
Level of unemployment

DISEASE
Webster defined disease as “a condition in which body’s health is impaired, a
departure from a state of health, an alteration of the human body interrupting
the performance of vital functions”.
2
The simplest definition is, of course, that disease is just the opposite of
health, i.e. any deviation from normal functioning or state of complete
physical or mental well-being.

=== PAGE 45 ===
Concepts of Causation
Up to the time of Louis Pasteur, various concepts of disease causation were
in vogue, e.g. the supernatural theory of disease, the theory of humors, etc.
Discoveries in microbiology marked a turning point in our aetiological
concepts.
1. Germ Theory of Disease
This concept gained momentum during the 19
th
 and the early part of the 20
th
century. The emphasis had shifted from empirical causes (bad air) to
microbes as the sole cause of disease. The concept in the germ theory of
disease is generally referred to as one-to-one relationship between causal
agent and disease. The disease model is as follow:
Disease agent → Man → Disease
It is now recognized that a disease is rarely caused by a single agent
alone, but rather depends upon a number of factors, which contribute to its
occurrence. Therefore, modern medicine has moved away from the strict
adherence to the germ theory of disease.
2. Epidemiological Triad
The germ theory of disease has many limitations. For example, not everyone
exposed to tuberculosis develops tuberculosis. The same exposure, however,
in an undernourished or otherwise susceptible person may result in clinical
disease. There are other factors relating to the host and environment, which
are equally important to determine whether or not disease will occur in the
exposed host. This demanded a broader concept of disease causation that
synthesized the basic factors of agent, host and environment.
The causative factors of disease may be classified as 
agent, host
 and
environment
. These three factors are referred as epidemiological triad. The
mere presence of agent, host and favourable environmental factors in the
prepathogenesis phase is not sufficient to start a disease in man. What is
required is interaction of these three factors to initiate the disease process in
man (
Fig. 1.1
). The agent, host and environment operating in combination
determine not only the onset of disease which may range from a single case

to epidemics but also the distribution of disease in community.
4c
Fig. 1.1:
 Interaction of agent, host and environment
Agent factors
:
 Agent is defined as a substance, living or non-living, or
a force, tangible or intangible, the excessive presence or relative lack of
which may initiate or perpetuate a disease process.
Disease agents are classified as:
Biological agents
: These agents include virus, bacteria, fungi,
rickettsiae, protozoa and metazoa. These exhibit infectivity,
pathogenicity and virulence.
Nutritional agents
: These can be proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
vitamins, minerals and water. Any excess or deficiency results
in nutritional disorder.
Physical agents
: Exposure to excessive heat, cold, humidity,
pressure, radiation, electricity and sound may result in illness.
Chemical agents:
Endogenous
: Chemicals produced in the body such as
urea, ketones, uric acid, etc.
Exogenous
: Agents arising outside the human host, e.g.
metals, allergens, fumes, dust and gases.
Mechanical agents
: Exposure to chronic friction and other
mechanical forces may result in crushing, tearing, sprains,

dislocations and even death.
Social agents
: These include smoking, poverty, abuse of drugs
and alcohol, unhealthy lifestyles, social isolation, maternal
deprivation, etc.
Host factors
:
 Host is defined as a person or other animal, including
birds and arthropods that affords subsistence or lodgment to an
infectious agent under natural conditions.
The host factors can be classified as:
Demographic characteristics such as age, sex.
Biological characteristics such as genetic factors.
Social and economic characteristics such as education,
occupation, and marital status.
Lifestyle factors such as personality traits, living habits, and
physical exercises.
Environmental factors
:
 Environment is defined as man’s external
surroundings.
It is divided into three components:
Physical environment
: This is applied to non-living things and
physical factors with which man is in constant interaction, e.g.
air, water, soil, housing, climate, heat, light, noise, debris, and
radiation.
Biological environment
: The biological environment is the
universe of living things, which surrounds man, including man
himself.
Psychosocial environment
: It is difficult to define psychosocial
environment due to the varied social, economic and cultural
contexts. It includes a complex of psychosocial factors which
are defined as those factors affecting personal health, health care
and community well-being that stem from the psychosocial
make-up of an individual and the structure and functions of
social groups. A stable and harmonious equilibrium between
man and his environment is needed to reduce man’s
vulnerability to diseases and to permit him to lead a more
productive and satisfying life.

=== PAGE 48 ===
3. Multifactorial Causation
Pettenkofer of Munich was an early proponent of this concept. As a result of
advances in public health, chemotherapy, antibiotics and vector control,
communicable diseases began to decline—only to be replaced by new types
of diseases, the so-called “modern” diseases of civilization, e.g. lung cancer,
coronary heart disease, chronic bronchitis, mental illness, etc. These diseases
could not be explained on the basis on the germ theory of disease nor could
they be prevented by the traditional methods of isolation, immunization or
improvements in sanitation. The realization began to dawn that the “single
cause idea” was an over simplification and that there are other factors in the
aetiology of diseases—social, economic, cultural, genetic and psychological
which are equally important.
Diseases such as coronary heart disease and cancer are due to multiple
factors. For example, excess of fat intake, smoking, lack of physical exercise,
and obesity are all involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease.
Most of these factors are linked to lifestyle and human behaviour. Thus this
model de-emphasizes the concept of disease “agent” and stress multiplicity of
interactions between host and environment. The multifactorial concept offers
multiple approaches for the prevention and control of disease.
4. Web of Causation
This model of disease causation was suggested by Mac Mahon and Pugh.
This model is ideally suited in the study of chronic disease, where the disease
agent is often not known, but is the outcome of interaction of multiple
factors.
The “web of causation” considers all the predisposing factors of any type
and their complex interrelations with each other. The web of causation does
not imply that the disease cannot be controlled unless all the multiple causes
or chains of causation or at least a number of them appropriately controlled or
removed. Sometimes removal or elimination of just one link or chain may be
sufficient to control disease, provided that link is sufficiently important in the
pathogenetic process.

=== PAGE 49 ===

b.
Natural History of Disease
Disease results from a complex interaction between man, an agent and the
environment. The term natural history of disease is a key concept in
epidemiology.
1
 It signifies the way in which a disease evolves over time from
the earliest stage of its prepathogenesis phase to its termination as recovery,
disability or death, in the absence of treatment or prevention. Each disease
has its own unique natural history, which is not necessarily the same in all
individuals, so much so, any general formulation of the natural history of
disease is necessarily arbitrary.
It is customary to describe the natural history of disease as consisting of
two phases:
Prepathogenesis
Pathogenesis.
a. Prepathogenesis Phase
This refers to the period preliminary to the onset of disease in man. The
disease agent has not yet entered man, but the factors which favour its
interaction with the human host are already existing in the environment. This
situation is frequently referred to as ‘man in midst of disease’ or ‘man
exposed to risk of disease’. Potentially, we are all in the prepathogenesis
phase of many diseases, both communicable and non-communicable.
4c
b. Pathogenesis Phase
The pathogenesis phase begins with the entry of disease ‘agent’ in the
susceptible human host. The further events in the pathogenesis phase are
clear-cut in infectious diseases, i.e. the disease agent multiplies and induces
tissue and physiologic changes, the disease progresses through a period of
incubation and later through early and late pathogenesis. The final outcome
of the disease may be recovery, disability or death. The pathogenesis phase
may be modified by intervention measures such as immunization and
chemotherapy.

=== PAGE 50 ===
Risk Factors
When the disease agent is not firmly established, the aetiology is generally
discussed in terms of “risk factors”. The term risk factor means an attribute or
exposure that is significantly associated with the development of a disease.
The presence of a risk factor does not imply that the disease will occur,
and in its absence, the disease will not occur. The important thing about risk
factors is that they are observable or identifiable prior to the event they
predict. The combination of risk factors in the same individual may be purely
additive or synergistic. For example, smoking and occupational exposure
(dye and leather industry) were found to have an additive effect as risk
factors for bladder cancer. On the other hand, smoking was found to be
synergistic with other risk factors such as hypertension and high blood
cholesterol. Risk factors may be truly causative or merely contributory. Some
risk factors can be modified (smoking); others cannot be modified (age, sex).
Epidemiological methods (case control and cohort studies) are needed to
identify risk factors and estimate the degree of risk. The detection of risk
factors will help in the prevention and intervention of diseases.

=== PAGE 51 ===
Spectrum of Disease
The term “spectrum of disease” is a graphic representation of variations in the
manifestations of disease. At one end of the disease, spectrum are subclinical
infections, which are not ordinarily identified and at the other end are fatal
illnesses.
In the middle of the spectrum, lie illnesses ranging in severity from mild
to severe. These different manifestations are simply reflections of
individual’s different states of immunity and receptivity. Leprosy is an
excellent example of the spectral concept of disease. The sequence of events
in the spectrum of disease can be interrupted by early diagnosis and treatment
or by preventive measures.

=== PAGE 52 ===
Iceberg of Disease
A concept closely related to the spectrum of disease is the concept of the
iceberg phenomenon of disease. According to this concept, disease in a
community may be compared with an iceberg (
Fig. 1.2
). The tip of the
iceberg represents what the physician sees in the community, i.e. clinical
cases. The vast submerged portion of the iceberg represents the hidden mass
of disease, i.e. latent, inapparent, presymptomatic and undiagnosed cases and
carriers in the community. The “water line” represents the demarcation
between apparent and inapparent disease. In some diseases [e.g.
hypertension, diabetes, anaemia, malnutrition, mental illness], the unknown
morbidity [i.e. the submerged portion of the iceberg] far exceeds the known
morbidity. The hidden part of the iceberg thus constitutes an important,
undiagnosed reservoir of infection or disease in the community, and its
detection and control is a challenge to modern techniques in preventive
medicine.
Fig. 1.2:
 The iceberg of disease

Disease Control
The term “disease control” describes operations aimed at reducing:
The incidence of disease
The duration of disease, and consequently the risk of transmission
The effects of infections, including both the physical and psychosocial
complications; and
The financial burden to the community.
Control activities may focus on primary prevention or secondary
prevention; most control programmes combine the two.
In disease control, the disease ‘agent’ is permitted to persist in the
community at a level where it ceases to be a public health problem according
to the tolerance of the local population. A state of equilibrium becomes
established between the disease agent, host and environment components of
the disease process.

=== PAGE 54 ===
Disease Elimination
The term “elimination” is used to describe interruption of transmission of
disease, as for example, elimination of measles, polio and diphtheria from
large geographic regions or areas.

=== PAGE 55 ===
Disease Eradication
Eradication literally means to “tear out by roots”. Eradication of disease
implies termination of all transmission of infection by extermination of the
infectious agent. The word eradication is reserved to cessation of infection
and disease from the whole world.
Totally, smallpox is the only disease that has been eradicated. Three
diseases have been seriously advanced as candidates for global eradication
within the foreseeable future; polio, measles and dracunculiasis. The
feasibility of eradicating polio appears to be greater than that of others.

SCREENING FOR DISEASES
Screening has been defined as “the search for unrecognized disease or defect
by means of rapidly applied tests, examinations or other procedures in
apparently healthy individuals”.
The original screening programmes were for individual diseases such as
tuberculosis, syphilis, etc. Over the years, the screening tests have steadily
grown in number. Today screening is considered a preventive care function,
and some consider it a logical extension of health care.
Screening differs from 
periodic health examinations
 in the following
respects:
Capable of wide application.
Relatively inexpensive
Requires little physician-time. In fact the physician is not required to
administer the test, but only to interpret it.
A screening test is not intended to be a diagnostic test. It is only an initial
examination. Those who are found to have positive test results are referred to
a physician for further diagnostic work-up and treatment.

=== PAGE 57 ===
Aims and Objectives of Screening
The basic purpose of screening is to sort out from a large group of apparently
healthy persons those likely to have the disease or at increased risk of the
disease under study, to bring those who are “apparently abnormal” under
medical supervision and treatment.

=== PAGE 58 ===
Criteria for Screening
The criteria for screening are based on two considerations
: The 
disease
 to be
screened, and the 
test
 to be applied.

Disease
The disease to be screened should fulfil the following criteria before it is
considered suitable for screening:
The condition sought should be an important health problem (in
general, prevalence should be high).
There should be a recognizable latent or early asymptomatic stage.
The natural history of the condition, including development from latent
to declared disease, should be adequately understood (so that we can
know at what stage the process ceases to be reversible).
There is a test that can detect the disease prior to the onset of signs and
symptoms.
Facilities should be available for confirmation of diagnosis.
There is an effective treatment.
There should be an agreed-on policy concerning whom treat as patients
(e.g. lower ranges of blood press borderline diabetes).
There is good evidence that early detection and treatment reduces
morbidity and mortality.
The expected benefits (e.g. the number of lives saved early detection)
exceed the risks and costs.
When the above criteria are satisfied, then it would be appropriate to
consider a suitable screening test.

=== PAGE 60 ===
Screening Test
The test must satisfy the criteria of acceptability, repeatable and validity,
besides others such as yield, simplicity, safety rapidity, ease of administration
and cost.
1. Acceptability
Since a high rate of cooperation is necessary, it is important that the test
should be acceptable to the people at whom it is aimed. In general, tests that
are painful, discomforting and embarrassing (e.g. rectal or vaginal
examinations) are not in likely to be acceptable to the population in mass
campaign.
2. Repeatability
An attribute of an ideal screening test or any measurement (e.g. height,
weight) is its repeatability (sometimes called reliability, precision or
reproducibility). That is, the test must give consistent results when repeated
more than once on the same individual or material, under the same
conditions. The repeatability of the test depends upon three major factors
namely observer variation, biological (or subject) variation and errors relating
to technical methods. For example, the measurement of blood pressure is
poorly, producible because it is subjected to all these three major factors.
3. Validity (Accuracy)
The term validity refers to what extent the test accurately measures which it
purports to measure. In other words, validity expresses the ability of a test to
separate or distinguish those who have the disease from those who do not.
Validity has two components—sensitivity and specificity. When
assessing the accuracy of a diagnostic test, one must consider both these
components. Both measurements are expressed as percentages. Sensitivity
and specificity are usually determined by applying the test to one group of
persons having the disease, and to a reference group not having the disease
(
Table 1.1
). Sensitivity and specificity, together with “predictive accuracy”
are inherent properties of a screening test.

=== PAGE 61 ===
Table 1.1:
 
Screening test result by diagnosis
The letter “a” (
Table 1.1
) denotes those individuals found positive on the
test who have the condition or disorder being studied (i.e. true positives). The
group labelled “b” includes those who have a positive test result but who do
not have the disease (i.e. false positives). Group “c” includes those with
negative test results but who have the disease (i.e. false negatives). Finally,
those with negative results who do not have the disease are included in group
“d” (i.e. true negatives).

Evaluation of a Screening Test
The following measures are used to evaluate a screening test:
Sensitivity = a/(a + c) × 100
Specificity = d/(b + d) × 100
Predictive value of a positive test a/(a + b) × 100
Predictive value of a negative test = d/(c + d) × 100
Let us rewrite 
Table 1.1
 substituting hypothetical figures (
Table 1.2
) and
calculate the above measures:
Table 1.2:
 
Screening test result by diagnosis
Sensitivity (true positive)
= (40/140) × 100 = 28.57%
Specificity (true negative)
= (9840/9860) × 100 = 99.79%
Predictive value = (9840/9940) × 100 = 98.9% of a negative test.
The term sensitivity was introduced by Yerushalmy in 1940s as a
statistical index of diagnostic accuracy. It has been defined as the ability of a
test to identify correctly all those who have the disease, that is “true positive”.
A 90% sensitivity means that 90% of the diseased people screened by the test
will give a “true positive” result and the remaining 10% a “false negative”
result.
Specificity
It is defined as the ability of a test to identify correctly those who do not have
the disease, i.e. “true negatives”. A 90% specificity means that 90% of the

=== PAGE 63 ===
1.
2.
non-diseased persons will give “true negative” result, 10 per cent of
nondiseased people screened by the test will be wrongly classified as
“diseased” when they are not.
Sensitivity
Sensitivity may be increased only at the expense of specificity and vice versa.
An ideal screening test should be 100% sensitive and 100% specific. In
practice, this seldom occurs.
Predictive Value of Test Result
For interpreting the test result (done on an individual), the predictive value of
positive test and predictive value of negative test are useful.
Predictive Value of Positive Test
Predictive value of positive test is the probability that a person actually has
the disease given that he or she tests positive. It is the probability that the
disease is present when the test result is positive. It is calculated as the
number of true positive results divided by true positive results and false
positive results. For the same test (for a given sensitivity, and specificity) the
predictive value of positive test will be higher when the test is done in a
population where the disease prevalence is higher compared to when the test
is done in a population where the disease prevalence is lower.
Predictive Value of Negative Test
Predictive value of negative test is the probability that an individual is truly
disease-free given that he or she tests negative. It is the probability that the
disease is not present when the test result is negative. It is calculated as the
number of true negative results divided by the true negative results and false
negative results.
The above test characteristics answer the following questions:
If the disease is present, what is the probability that the test result will
be positive? (Sensitivity)
If the disease is absent, what is the probability that the test result will
be negative? (Specificity)

Uses of Screening
Case detection
:
 It is the identification of unrecognised disease, which
does not arise from a patient’s request, e.g. diabetes mellitus, iron
deficiency anaemia.
Control of disease
:
 People are examined for the benefit of others, e.g.
screening of immigrants from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis
and syphilis to protect the home population.
Research purposes
:
 Screening may sometimes be performed for
research purposes. For example, there are many chronic diseases whose
natural history is not fully known (e.g. cancer, hypertension).
Screening may aid in obtaining more basic knowledge about the
natural history of such diseases, provides a prevalence estimate and
subsequent screening, an incidence figure.
Educational opportunities
:
 Screening provides opportunities for
creating public awareness and for educating health professionals.

INFECTION
Definition
The entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent in the
body of man or animals.

=== PAGE 67 ===
Dynamics of Disease Transmission
Communicable diseases are transmitted from the reservoir or source of
infection to susceptible host. Basically, there are three links in the chain of
transmission, viz. the reservoir, modes of transmission and the susceptible
host.

Sources and Reservoir
The starting point for the occurrence of a communicable disease is the
existence of a reservoir source of infection.
Source of infection is defined as “the person, animal, object or substance
from which an infectious agent passes or is disseminated to the host.”
A reservoir is defined as “any person, animal, arthropod, plant or
substance or (combination of these) in which an infectious agent lives and
multiplies, on which it depends primarily for survival, and where it
reproduces itself in such manner that it can be transmitted to a susceptible
host.”
2
The reservoir may be of three types
:
Human reservoir
Animal reservoir
Reservoir in non-living things
1. Human Reservoir
By far the most important source or reservoir of infection for humans is man
himself. He may be a case or carrier. Man is often described as his own
enemy because most of the communicable diseases, which man contracts, are
from human sources.
Cases
:
 A case is defined as “a person in the population or study group
identified as having the particular disease, health disorder or condition
under investigation.”
1
Carriers
:
 A carrier is defined as “an infected person or animal that
harbours a specific infectious agent in the absence of discernible
clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection for others.”
The elements in a carrier state are:
The presence in the body of the disease agent.
The absence of recognizable symptoms and signs of disease.
The shedding of the disease agent in the discharges or excretions, thus
acting as a source of infection for other persons.

The source of infection may sometimes be animals and birds. The diseases
and infections which are transmissible to man from vertebrates are called
zoonoses. These are over 100 zoonotic diseases which may be conveyed to
man from animals and birds. The best known examples are rabies, yellow
fever and influenza.
3. Reservoir in Non-living Things
Soil and inanimate matter can also act as reservoirs of infection. For example,
soil may harbour agents that cause tetanus, anthrax, coccidioidomycosis and
mycetoma.

Modes of Transmission
Communicable diseases may be transmitted from the reservoir or source of
infection to a susceptible individual in many different ways, depending upon
the infectious agent, portal of entry and the local ecological conditions.
The mode of transmission of infectious diseases may be classified as
below:
Direct transmission
Direct contact
Droplet infection
Contact with soil
Inoculation into skin or mucosa
Transplacental (vertical)
Indirect transmission
Vehicle-borne
Vector-borne
Mechanical
Biological
Air-borne
Droplet nuclei
Dust
Fomite-borne
Unclean hands and fingers
A. Direct Transmission
Direct contact
:
 Infection may be transmitted by direct contact from
skin-to-skin, mucosa-to-mucosa, or mucosa to skin of the same, or
another person. This implies direct and essentially immediate transfer
of infectious agents from the reservoir or source to a susceptible
individual.
Diseases transmitted by direct contact includes STD and AIDS,

=== PAGE 71 ===
2.

5.
1.
leprosy, leptospirosis, skin and eye infections.
Droplet infection
:
 This is direct projection of a spray of droplets of
saliva and nasopharyngeal secretions during coughing, sneezing, or
speaking and spitting, talking into the surrounding atmosphere.
In infectious diseases, these droplets, which may contain millions of
bacteria and viruses can be a source of infection to others. When a
healthy susceptible person comes within the range of these infected
droplets he is likely to inhale some of them and acquire infection.
1
Diseases transmitted by droplet spread include many respiratory
infections, eruptive fevers, many infections of the nervous system,
common cold, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis,
meningococcal meningitis, etc.
Contact with soil
:
 The disease agent may be acquired by direct
exposure of susceptible tissue to the disease agent in soil, compost or
decaying vegetable matter in which it normally leads a saprophytic
existence, e.g. hookworm larvae, tetanus, mycosis, etc.
Inoculation into skin or mucosa
:
 The disease agent may be inoculated
directly into the skin or mucosa, e.g. rabies virus by dog bite, hepatitis
B virus through contaminated needles and syringes, etc.
Transplacental or vertical transmission
:
 Disease agents can be
transmitted transplacentally. This is another form of direct
transmission. Examples include the so-called TORCH agents
(Toxoplasma gondii
 rubella virus, ctyomegalovirus and herpes virus).
B. Indirect Transmission
This embraces a variety of mechanisms including the traditional 5 Fs—“flies,
fingers, fomites, food and fluid”. An essential requirement for indirect
transmission is that the infectious agent must be capable of surviving outside
the human host in the external environment and retainits basic properties of
pathogenesis and virulence till it finds a new host.
Vehicle-borne
:
 Vehicle-borne transmission implies transmission of the
infectious agent through the agency of water, food (including raw
vegetables, fruits, milk and milk products), ice, blood, serum, plasma
or other biological products such as tissues and organs. Of these, water

=== PAGE 72 ===
2.

b.

5.
and food are the most frequent vehicles of transmission, because every
one uses them. The infectious agent may have multiplied or developed
in the vehicle. Diseases transmitted by water and food include chiefly
infections of the alimentary tract, e.g. acute diarrhoea, typhoid fever,
cholera.
2
Vector-borne
:
 In infectious disease epidemiology, vector is defined as
an arthropod or any living carrier (e.g. snail) that transports an
infectious agent to a susceptible individual. Transmission by a vector
may be mechanical or biological. In the latter case, the disease agent
passes through a developmental cycle or multiplication in the vector.
Air-borne
:
Droplet nuclei
: “Droplet nuclei” are a type of particles
implicated in the spread of air-borne infection. They are tiny
particles that represent the dried residue of droplets. The droplet
nuclei may remain air-borne for long periods of time, some
retaining and others losing infectivity or virulence. Diseases
spread by droplet nuclei include tuberculosis, influenza,
chickenpox, measles.
Dust
: Some of the larger droplets which are expelled during
talking, coughing or sneezing, settle down by their sheer weight
on the floor, carpets, furniture, clothes, bedding, linen and other
objects in the immediate environment and become part of the
dust. A variety of infectious agents (e.g. streptococci, other
pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungal spores) and skin
squamae have been found in the dust of hospital wards and
living rooms. Dust particles may also be blown from the soil by
wind; this may include fungal spores.
Fomite-borne
:
 Fomites are inanimate articles or substances other than
water or food contaminated by the infectious discharges from a patient
and capable of harbouring and transferring the infectious agent to a
healthy person. Fomites include soiled clothes, towels, linen,
handkerchiefs, cups. The fomites play an important role in indirect
infection. Diseases transmitted by fomites include diphtheria, typhoid
fever, bacillary dysentery, hepatitis A, eye and skin infections.
Unclean hands and fingers
:
 Hands are the most common medium by

=== PAGE 73 ===
which pathogenic agents are transferred to food from the skin, nose,
bowel, etc. as well as from other foods. The transmission takes place
both directly (hand-to-mouth) and indirectly.

=== PAGE 74 ===
a.

d.
SUSCEPTIBLE HOST
Four stages have been described in successful parasitism:
First, the infectious agent must find a portal of entry by which it may
enter the host. There are many portals of entry, e.g. respiratory tract,
alimentary tract, genitourinary tract, skin, etc. Some organisms may
have more than one portal of entry, e.g. hepatitis B, Q fever,
brucellosis.
On gaining entry into the host, the organisms must reach the
appropriate tissue or “Site of election” in the body of the host where it
may find optimum conditions for its multiplication and survival.
Thirdly, the disease agent must find a way out of the body (Portal of
exit) in order that it may reach a new host and propagate its species. If
there is no portal of exit, the infection becomes a dead-end infection as
in rabies, bubonic plague, tetanus and trichinosis.
After leaving the human body, the organism must survive in the
external environment for sufficient period till a new host is found. In
addition, a successful disease agent should not cause the death of the
host but produce only a low-grade immunity so that the host is
vulnerable again and again to the same infection. The best example is
common cold virus.

=== PAGE 75 ===
Stages of an Infectious Disease
All infectious diseases pass through five stages.
1. Incubation Period
An infection becomes apparent only after a certain incubation period, which
is defined as “the time interval between invasion by an infectious agent and
appearance of the first sign or symptom of the disease in question.” During
the incubation period, the infectious agent undergoes multiplication in the
host. When a sufficient density of the disease agent is built up in the host, the
health equilibrium is disturbed and the disease become overt.
Non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and mental illness,
also have incubation periods, which may be months or years. The term latent
period is used in noninfectious diseases as the equivalent of incubation period
in infectious diseases. Latent period has been defined as “the period from
disease initiation to disease detection”.
2. The Onset or Prodromal Stage
This commences when the first symptoms appear and continue until the
condition is well developed.
3. The Period of Advance or Fastigium
All the symptoms are now increasing in severity until a climax is reached.
4. Period of Defervescence
All the symptoms are now decreasing in severity.
5. Period of Convalescence
The patient has overcome completely the invaders and toxins.

Specific Defenses
Specific defenses come into play, once microorganisms have breached local
defense mechanisms. By virtue of these defenses, the host is able to
recognize, destroy and eliminate antigenic material (e.g. bacteria, viruses,
proteins, etc.) foreign to his own. A person is said to be immune when he
possesses “specific protective antibodies or cellular immunity as a result of
previous infection or immunization, or is so conditioned by such previous
experience as to respond adequately to prevent infection and/or clinical
illness following exposure to a specific infectious agent.”
2
The specific defenses may be discussed for convenience under the
following heads:
Active immunity
Humoral immunity
Cellular immunity
Combination of the above
Passive immunity
Normal human Ig
Specific human Ig
Animal antitoxins or antisera
1. Active Immunity
It is the immunity which an individual develops as a result of infection or by
specific immunization and is usually associated with presence of antibodies
or cells having a specific action on the microorganism concerned with a
particular infectious disease or on its toxic.
Active immunity may be acquired in 3 ways:
Following clinical infection (e.g. chicken-pox, rubella and measles)
Following subclinical or in apparent infection (e.g. polio and
diphtheria)
Following immunization with an antigen which may be a killed
vaccine, a live-attenuated vaccine or toxoid.

=== PAGE 77 ===
a.
b.
c.
i.
ii.
Humoral immunity
:
 Humoral immunity comes from the B cells (bone
marrow derived lymphocytes) which proliferate and manufacture
specific antibodies after antigen presentation by macrophages. The
antibodies are localized in the immunoglobulin fraction of the serum.
These antibodies circulate in the body and act directly by neutralizing
the microbe, or its toxin or rendering the microbe susceptible to attack
by the polymorphonuclear leucocyte and the monocytes. The
complement system, together with antibodies is necessary for efficient
phagocytosis of bacteria.
Cellular immunity
:
 It is now well-recognized that cellular immunity
plays a fundamental role in resistance to infection. It is mediated by the
T cells which differentiate into subpopulations able to help B
lymphocytes. The T cells do not secrete antibody, but are responsible
for recognition of antigen. On contact with antigen, the T cells initiate a
chain of responses. For example, activation of macrophages, release of
cytotoxic factors, mononuclear inflammatory reactions, delayed
hypersensitivity reactions, secretion of immunological mediators (e.g.
immuno interferon), etc. There is growing evidence that cellular
immunity is responsible for immunity against many diseases including
tuberculosis, brucellosis and also for the body’s rejection of foreign
material, such as skin grafts. The importance of cell-mediated
immunity can be appreciated from the fact that a child born with a
defect in humoral antibody production may survive for as long as 6
years without replacement therapy, but a severe defect in cell-mediated
immunity will result in death within the first 6 months of life.
Combination of the above
:
 In addition to the B and T lymphoid cells
which are responsible for recognizing self and nonself, very often, they
co-operate with one another and with certain accessory cells such as
macrophages and human K (killer) cells, and their joint functions
constitute the complex events of immunity.
Active immunity takes time to develop. It is superior to passive immunity
because:
The duration of protection, like that of the natural infection is
frequently long-lasting.
With few exceptions, severe reactions are rare.

=== PAGE 78 ===
iii.
iv.
a.
b.
c.
The protective efficacy of active immunization exceeds that of passive
immunization, and in some instances, approaches 100%.
Active immunization is less expensive than passive immunization.
Vaccines are cheaper to produce than are antisera.
2. Passive Immunity
When antibodies produce in one body (human or animal) are transferred to
another to induce protection against disease, it is known as passive immunity.
In other words, the body does not produce its own antibodies but depends
upon ready-made antibodies. Passive immunity may be induced:
By administration of an antibody-containing preparation
(immunoglobulin or antiserum)
By transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta. Human milk
also contains protective antibodies (IgA)
By transfer of lymphocytes, to induce passive cellular immunity—this
procedure is still experimental.

=== PAGE 79 ===
Immunoglobulins
a. Normal human Ig
Normal human Ig is an antibody-rich fraction (Cohn fraction II). Obtained
from a pool of at least 1000 donors. The WHO has laid down definite
standards for its preparation. For example, the preparation should contain at
least 90 percent intact IgG; it should be as free as possible from IgG
aggregates; all IgG subclasses should be present; there should be a low IgA
concentration; the level of antibody against at least two bacterial species and
two viruses should be ascertained.
Normal human Ig is used to prevent measles in highly susceptible
individuals and to provide temporary protection (up to 12 weeks) against
hepatitis A infection for travelers to endemic areas and to control institutional
and household outbreaks of hepatitis A infection.
b. Specific human Ig
The specific (hyper immune) human Ig should contain at least 5 times the
antibody potential of the standard preparation per unit volume. These
preparations are made from the plasma of patients who have recently
recovered from an infection or are obtained from individuals who have been
immunized against a specific infection. They therefore have a high antibody
content against an individual infection and provide immediate protection, e.g.
specific human Igs are used for chickenpox prophylaxis of highly susceptible
individuals and for postexposure prophylaxis of hepatitis B, and rabies and
for tetanus prophylaxis in the wounded.

=== PAGE 80 ===
a.
b.
c.
Antisera or Antitoxins
The term antiserum is applied to materials prepared in animals. Originally
passive immunization was achieved by the administration of antisera or
antitoxins prepared from non-human sources such as horses. Since human
immunoglobulin preparations exist only for a small number of diseases,
antitoxins prepared from non-human sources (against tetanus, diphtheria,
botulism, gas gangrene and snake bite) are still the mainstay of passive
immunization. Administration of antisera may occasionally give rise to serum
sickness and anaphylactic shock due to abnormal sensitivity of the recipient.
Passive immunity differs from active immunity in the following respects
:
Immunity is rapidly established.
Immunity produced is only temporary (days to months) till the
antibody is eliminated from the body.
There is no education of the reticuloendothelial system.
Passive immunization is useful for individual who cannot form antibodies
or for the normal host who takes time to develop antibodies following active
immunization.

Conclusion
Health, disease, infection and their concepts have evolved over the years after
a series of trials and errors. There is bound to be changes in the future and we
will each have an opportunity to reject the existing and take advantage of new
knowledge of newer diseases, their diagnosis, prevention and treatment.
Whatever the new technological developments one saying is sure to stay
“
Health is Wealth
”.

CHAPTER
2
The Practice
of Public Health
People’s health in India needs substantial improvement. The situation is
similar across the developing world, Bangladesh, Pakistan or beyond such as
Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, Brazil, etc. all have regrettably poor public
health.
1
 In India, little attention is paid to public health issues such as
availability of clean drinking water, the sewerage system.
1
 There is an urgent
need to improve public health in India even though the task is overwhelming
and undeniably complex.
Public health deals with ‘protecting and improving the health of
communities’. Broadly speaking, it includes actions, such as preventing the
outbreak of infections, e.g. cholera or the spread of communicable diseases
like HIV or preventing injuries due to road traffic accidents, falls and/or
violence. It also includes promoting healthy lifestyle such as educating the
public about (a) the importance of exercise or (b) the harmful effect of
smoking or (c) harmful effect of secondhand smoking or (d) the importance
of oral hygiene.
2
–
6
Governments use public health initiatives or programmes to achieve their
goals. These programmes or initiatives include—detecting and controlling
outbreak of infectious diseases, proper town planning, providing clean
drinking water, sewerage systems, garbage collection systems, provision of a
road and traffic system that prevents road traffic accidents, provision of clean
air and water, etc.

 Some examples of national health programmes in India
include the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), National Malaria
Control Programme, National Cancer Control Programme, etc.

Definition
Public
Knutson defined 
PUBLIC
 as ‘of or pertaining to the people of a community,
state, or nation.’

Public Health
Given the difficulty in defining public health, the definition proposed by
Charles Edward Amory Winslow in 1920 is still the most widely accepted.
3
–
5
Winslow (1920) defined public health as 
“The science and art of
preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting physical and mental
efficiency through organized community efforts for the sanitation of the
environment, the control of communicable infections, the education of
the individuals in personal hygiene, the organization of medical and
nursing services for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of
disease, and the development of the social machinery to ensure everyone
a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health, so
organizing these benefits as to enable every citizen to realize his
birthright of health and longevity.”

The focus of public health has expanded over time. Since its conception
when the focus was asepsis to sanitary engineering, to preventative physical
and mental health. Health promotion along with comprehensive health
services and behavioural interventions are important tools of community
medicine.

HISTORY OF MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
IN EUROPE AND AMERICA
Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates spoke of the relationship of one’s
environment, i.e. water, nutrition, climate and lifestyle and one’s health. He
was able to distinguish between disease that happened at an ‘expected rate’,
i.e. endemic and diseases that occurred at a ‘higher than expected rate’, i.e.
epidemic in a population.
3
 Archaeological excavations of the Roman
civilization show water and sanitation systems and point towards their
awareness of public health.
The European middle ages (500–1400) were marked by high mortality
rates due to widespread diseases, including bubonic plagues. Poor living
conditions, overcrowded cities contributed to many of the diseases witnessed
at this time.
3
,
4
 Towards the end of the middle ages, many European cities
passed laws to improve the living conditions of their citizens. Some of the
public health practices from the middle ages survive even today. For
example, 
quarantine
, a practice that involves isolating people those with
illness from those who are healthy. The word 
quarantine
 comes from the
Italian word ‘
quarantenaria
’ which means forty days.
3
The middle ages were followed by the Renaissance period. Giolamo
Fracastoro (1478–1533) proposed that infection is caused by agents that are
not visible to the naked eye. However, his proposition was not accepted until
Anton von Leeuwenhock (1632–1723) demonstrated the presence of these
microscopic organisms. Even then it would be another 200 years before the
‘Germ Theory’ was accepted in the late nineteenth century. The Renaissance
period was marked by revolutions in every sphere political, industrial,
religious, scientific, medical and public health. Some public health experts
think that the French revolution which called for equality for all, also brought
a social understanding of health. It had an effect across Europe. The English
made enquiries into the higher death rate among certain professions such as
miners or vulnerable groups such as infants. These were small steps in some
areas of public health. Other areas of health were still neglected. For
example, mental illness was stigmatized and people with mental illness were
commonly institutionalized.

=== PAGE 86 ===
The industrial revolution (1700–1900) which followed was marked by
mass migration from rural areas to the cities. This mass migration led to
overcrowding and contributed to an increase in diseases. Cities were
unplanned and had few amenities. There were few toilets, poor sewerage and
garbage removal systems. This further added to the health woes of the people
and epidemics were common. It was during one of these outbreaks that John
Snow (1813–1858) a British physician conducted his investigation. He
mapped the cholera cases in London and showed that the cluster of cholera
cases was related to the poor quality of water.
3
–
5
 John Snow used statistics to
show that the ‘mortality rate among those drinking water from lower (river)
Thames was 8.5 times greater than those drinking from upper Thames’. Thus
showing that contaminated water was responsible for the cholera outbreak.
The increasing incidence of diseases and poor environmental conditions
led to the Public Health Act of 1848 in England. The actions that followed
were brought about by collective social responsibility and marked the
beginning of a government taking the responsibility of safeguarding the
health of its citizens. It is commonly referred to as the “Great Sanitary
Awakening” which took place in England in the mid-19
th
 century. This had a
tremendous impact in modifying the behaviour of people and ushering an era
of public health. A new thinking began to take shape, i.e. the state has a direct
responsibility for the health of the people. The Public Health Act of 1848 was
thus a fulfillment of a dream.
3
–
5
 By the beginning of the 20
th
 century, the
broad foundations of public health—clean water, clean surroundings,
wholesome condition of houses, control of offensive trades, etc., were laid in
England, America and the European nations.
16
–
18
Since its independence, India has taken rather slow steps in achieving its
public health goals. Health indicators of infant, 5-year and maternal mortality
rates show a small improvement. These improvements reflect some of these
achievements. However, India has a long way to go and many issues to
resolve before the Indian citizens can enjoy the same level of public health
services as the developed world.

HISTORY OF MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
IN INDIA
From time immemorial man has been trying to control disease and live a
healthy life. India being an ancient civilization has witnessed many invasions
and with it came different systems of medicine. India’s alternative medicine
comprise of six systems, namely Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani,
Siddha and Homeopathy. Popularly known as AYUSH, these systems were
in use at the time Western medicine arrived in India.
6
–
11
Ayurveda, Siddha, Yoga and Naturo-pathy—the indigenous systems have
been in existence for centuries. Experts date the existence of Ayurveda,
Siddha, Naturopathy and Yoga back to 3000 to 1400 BC. There is further
historical evidence indicating that Ayurveda was taught formally at the
ancient Universities of Taxila and Nalanda between 600 BC and 600 AD.
6
–
11
The Unani system of medicine originated in Greece and was further
developed by the Arabs before it being introduced to India in 1350 (by the
Arabs). The Unani system has flourished since then and is still being used.
Homeopathy was developed by Samuel Hahnemann in Germany 200
years ago and arrived in India in early 19
th
 century. It flourished in Bengal
before spreading to the rest of India. It is based on the two theories ‘like cures
like’ and ‘law of minimum dose’.
These complimentary forms of medicine are supported by the National
Rural Health Mission (NRHM), which was introduced in 2005 in India.
7
–
9
AYUSH is mainly practiced in India and the neighbouring countries. A
survey found out that approximately 30% of the Indian population used
AYUSH.
7
 However, recent years have seen increasing popularity of some of
these systems such as Yoga and Ayurveda world-wide.
9
–
11
The role of AYUSH in promoting and maintaining public health over the
past centuries is unclear and needs further investigation. There is
archaeological evidence indicating that ancient Indians were aware of
environmental sanitation. The Indus Valley civilization has been dated to
4500 to 3000 BC. At the excavation sites of Mohenjodaro and Harappa (cities
now in Pakistan), show relics of planned cities with drainage, houses and

=== PAGE 89 ===
public baths built of baked bricks.
12
 These ancient excavations provide the
earliest evidence about the awareness of environmental sanitation in India.
Besides AYUSH, there were other unorganized forms of relief provided
by the medicine man, the priest, the herborist, folk medicine and the
magician. With changes in the political conditions in India, the torch, which
was lighted thousands of years ago by the ancient sages grew dim, medical
education and medical services became static and the ancient universities and
hospitals disappeared.

CHANGING CONCEPTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
In the history of public health, four distinct phases may be demarcated.
16
–
19

=== PAGE 93 ===
a. Disease Control Phase (1880–1920)
Public health during the 19
th
 century was largely a matter of sanitary
legislation and reforms aimed at the control of the physical environment.
These measures included providing clean drinking water, proper sewerage
and drainage systems and greatly improved the health of the people.

=== PAGE 94 ===
b. Health Promotional Phase (1920–1960)
The concept of health promotion began to take shape at the beginning of 20
th
century. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes health promotion
as “the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve,
their health. It moves beyond the focus on individual behaviour towards a
wide range of social and environmental interventions”.

=== PAGE 95 ===
c. Social Engineering Phase
Public health entered a new phase in the 1960s described as the social
engineering phase. A new concept ‘
risk factors
’ came into existence as
chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes or behavioural problems such as
alcoholism, addiction, overweight and obesity could not be explained by the
germ theory. With this new concept, public health moved into preventive and
rehabilitative phase.

=== PAGE 96 ===
d. Health for All Phase (1981–2000 AD)
In 1981, the WHO members pledged themselves to an ambitious target to
provide Health for All by the year 2000, that is “attainment of a level of
health that will permit all peoples, to lead a socially and economically
productive life”.
3
–

,
16
‘Health for All’ is a holistic concept. It implies the removal of obstacles
to attaining health, including elimination of malnutrition, ignorance, etc. and
the supply of clean water, air and proper sewerage system, etc. It symbolizes
the determination of the countries of the world to provide an acceptable level
of health to all people.

biostatistics, sociology, public health law and regulation, health economics,
anthropology, health behaviour and education, public health engineering,
public health research, etc.

Epidemiology is the study of the causes, distribution and control of disease in
population. The World Health Organization defines epidemiology as “the
study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states and events
(including diseases), and the application of this study to the control of
diseases and other health problems”.
20
Epidemiological methods include surveillance to understand the burden
of a disease in a population, descriptive studies and analytical studies. It
measures health, diseases (both acute and chronic) and assessing risk,
exposure and interpreting data.

Measuring Health
Measuring health of a population is not a simple task. How does one measure
health of a population? Is the absence of any disease sufficient to label the
population as healthy? If one were to take such a view, then how would one
address the issues such as child neglect or abuse, overweight and obesity.
Given the difficulties of measuring health, many countries still use mortality,
morbidity or life expectancy rates as a measure of health.
Assessing Risk, Exposure and Interpreting Data
A public health risk assessment involves determining to what extent the given
population has been or are being exposed to a ‘hazard’ and whether the
exposure to this hazard is harmful. It involves assessing the likelihood of a
harmful effect following exposure.
The public health risk assessment would involve determining whether and
to what extent people have been or are being exposed to certain air pollutants,
whether the exposure at the current level is harmful. The assessment involves
defining the risk and protective factors. For example, suicide risk assessment
among adolescents and young adults.

Biostatistics
Biostatistics is an important aspect of epidemiology. It supports the
population research by: (1) collecting and organizing data, e.g. distribution of

=== PAGE 99 ===
cases and controls, rates and proportions (2) analyzing data, e.g. regression,
survival analysis.

=== PAGE 100 ===
Public Health Education
Public health education is an important aspect of public health as it promotes
healthy behaviours and healthy lifestyles and in turn reduces diseases and
injuries. For example, statutory statements about the health effects of
smoking on cigarettes packets such as smoking causes cancer or smoking
increases the risk of cancer.

Public Health Law
Public health law is a key component of public health. It assists the
government in protecting and promoting the health of its citizens. It helps to
formulate health policies, laws and regulations.
3
–
6
 Examples of public health
laws and regulations of India include:
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act
Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques Act and Rules
Consumer Protection Act and Medical Profession
A typical public health department would include a large number of
specialists. A typical team could include maternal and child specialists, dental
and other medical specialists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, data
analysists, engineers, town planners, local health workers, a disaster
management team, laboratory personnel, radiation safety personnel, health
economists, sociologists, law enforcement officers (e.g. drug-/alcohol-related
issues), behavioural and environmental scientists, officers dealing with public
affairs and other administration officers.

The examples below are over simplified with the aim to an impression of
the issues involved.
Example 1
. As a public health officer of your town or city, you are
concerned about the sudden increase of cases within your jurisdiction. You
may ask the epidemiologist to find out ‘why’ because understanding the
cause is important to formulate a plan.
Example 2
. As a public health officer of your town or city, you are
concerned that a local construction may have damaged a drinking water
supply pipe. You would then formulate a plan. The plan could include: (1)
Asking the engineer to find out, if the supply pipe has been damaged, (2)
Getting the laboratory team to check the quality of water, (3) Alerting the
medical team, (4) Informing other officers such as the public affairs in case a
warning has to be issued to the public about a possible outbreak and how to
deal with it.
It is important to know difference between public health and
epidemiology. Epidemiology is but a tool of public health. It provides a better
understanding of health, diseases, injuries and health outcomes by mapping

=== PAGE 102 ===

3.
distribution and its determinants. Epidemiology, broadly speaking, measures
health or the burden of disease and/injury in a population.
Understanding the Term Population
The term population in public health can vary depending upon what each
particular public health programme aims to achieve.
For example, ‘health programme for school children’ can be for:
A particular school—in which case the term ‘population’ includes all
the children currently attending that particular school.
A district—in which case the term ‘population’ includes all the
currently attending a school—public or private in that particular
district.
A country—in which case the term ‘population’ includes all the
currently attending school—public or private in the country.
So the term population can be referring to a community or local area (e.g.
Karol Bagh in New Delhi). It can refer to larger regions such as district,
towns, cities or the entire country. WHO often refers to much larger
geographical regions that include a number of countries, e.g. South-East Asia
or Asia-Pacific.

CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH
METHOD
Group responsibility
:
 Public health work must be done in areas where
group responsibility is recognized. For this reason, contagious diseases
received some of the earliest attention, since it was obviously a group
responsibility that a man be made safe from his neighbour. This
concept led first to quarantine and isolation procedures, later to the
mass preventive measures.
Team work
:
 This is done partly for the necessity of efficient handling
of large groups of people and partly to the fact that many processes,
which are involved in prevention lent themselves particularly well to
team work.
Prevention
:
 Prevention is in itself a major objective in public health
programmes. The three reasons being:
Prevention of disease is an even greater good in life than the
cure of disease.
Advantage of team work.
Cost efficiency.
Multifactorial
:
 Public health methods have ability to deal with all sorts
of problems involving the host population and the environment. The
disease is recognized for what it really is a multifactorial problem.
Epidemiologist will look for host factors and environmental factors and
try to control them.
Medical indigence
:
 As an aid to the medically indigent, the concept
has arisen that health care is a right of citizenship and hence to be
provided by government to the extent available.
Biostatistics
:
 Public health methods are dependent on biostatistics.
Problems in a community require accurate measurement of rates and
lead us to the question whether differences are real. Mathematical
measurement of probability becomes necessary.
Computer science
:
 Computer science has vastly increased the ease of
data analysis, even with small samples.

=== PAGE 104 ===
viii.
ix.
x.
xi.
Apparently healthy population
:
 Public health work deals with
apparently healthy population, which brings in a cheerful and hopeful
atmosphere to the work. But the worker must go looking for minimal
disease instead of waiting for frank disease to come to him.
Education
:
 Education of the public becomes a prime objective of
public health work. Educating the public helps in active participation of
the community in the public programmes conducted.
Logistics
:
 Logistics requires attention here, with attention to the
location of and transportation of health care facilities. Care should be
brought as close as possible to where the people are normally
concentrated.
Insurance
:
 Budgeting of payment in regular installments provides an
aid, which closely resembles insurance to meet the technically
demanding and expensive dental treatment.

CHARACTERISTIC OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TECHNIQUES
A number of techniques are characteristic of the public health method. The
important ones are the:
Use of the health centre
Case finding
Use of community health council
Use of health centre
:
 Health centres are community buildings to house
health administration and a number of outpatient or preventive services
not easily housed in a hospital. It is usually located in the central part
of a community. A small auditorium for public health meeting is a
valuable addition. One health centre might be expected to serve a
community of some 50,000 to 1,00,000 people. Health units may be
present in certain public schools. A variant of the health unit is the
school-based dental clinic seen occasionally in the US and Canada and
predominantly in New Zealand and Australia.
Case finding
:
 It is otherwise known as “Screening.” It is important to
search apparently healthy populations for cases of early disease. The
object is to cover as large a population as possible with as simple a test
as it will yield helpful results. Case finding procedures in dentistry are
at times a matter of controversy. There are some public health officials
who feel that because dental disease is almost universal all school
children should be routinely referred to sources of dental treatment.
Community health council
:
 It consists of members representing key
people in the community from both voluntary and government agencies
and the community at large. An essential feature of good public health
practice is a broad desire on the path of people in all walks of life to
see the health programmes as a good one to understand it. This can be
attained by a community health council. These councils are often
associated with
Community fund raising efforts
Provide a forum for the exchange of information between

=== PAGE 106 ===
•
various health agencies and the public for the development of
new ideas.
These councils not only serve as media for communication but
also have approval or disapproval power over both new and
existing institutional health services in their areas.

=== PAGE 107 ===
Conclusion
Public health deals with the health of a population. Simply put, it refers to the
health of every person. It aims to improve the health by preventing diseases
and injuries and promoting healthy lifestyle. It is based on the philosophy of
social justice and relies on the principles of prevention and health promotion
to achieve its goal of ‘health for all’.

CHAPTER

Environment
and Health
Man is living in a dangerous and highly complicated environment, and he is
becoming more ingenious. If these trends continue it is feared that the very
“quality of life” we cherish may soon be in danger.
The purpose of environmental health is to create and maintain ecological
conditions that will promote health and thereby prevent disease. Major
factors contributing to ill health in India are unsafe drinking water,
unhygienic disposal of solid wastes and human excreta, poor housing,
sanitation, air and noise pollution.
The foremost step in any health programme would be to eliminate,
through environmental control, those factors which are hazardous to health.

=== PAGE 111 ===
WATER
Water quality is as important as water quantity. Much of the ill health is
largely due to lack of safe drinking water. There can be no state of positive
community health and wellbeing without safe water supply.

Safe and Wholesome Water
Water intended for human consumption should not only be ‘safe’ but also
‘wholesome’. A safe water is one that cannot harm the consumer, even when
ingested over prolonged periods.
Safe, potable or wholesome water is defined as:
Free from pathogenic agents
Free from harmful chemical substances
Pleasant to taste
Usable for domestic purposes.

Sources of Water
Water sources conform to two criteria:
The quality of water must be acceptable.
The quantity must be sufficient to meet the present and future
requirements.
There are three main sources of water:
Rain
Surface water
Impounding reservoirs
Rivers and streams
Tanks, ponds and lakes
Ground water
Shallow wells
Deep wells
Springs
1. Rain
Rain is the prime source of water. A part of rainwater sinks into the ground to
form groundwater. A part of it evaporates back into the atmosphere, and
some runs off to form streams and rivers which flow ultimately into the sea.
Some of the water in the soil is taken up by the plants and evaporated in turn
by the leaves. This event is water cycle.
Characteristics
Rainwater is the purest water.
Physically, it is clear, bright and sparkling.
Chemically, it is very soft water.
Bacteriologically, it is free from pathogenic agents.
Impurities

=== PAGE 114 ===

b.
•
•

c.
Rainwater tends to become impure by picking up the suspended impurities
from the atmosphere such as dust, microorganisms, and gases.
2. Surface Water
Surface water originates from rainwater.
Impounding reservoirs
:
 These are artificial lakes constructed usually
of earthwork or, masonry in which large quantities of surface water are
stored. Dams provide large reservoirs of surface water.
Characteristics:
It is fairly good quality of water.
Usually clear, palatable and ranks next to the rainwater in purity.
Usually soft.
Free of pathogenic organisms.
Impurities
Impurities are from human habitations and animal keeping or grazing.
River
:
 Many rivers furnish a dependable supply of water.
Characteristics
It is turbid during rainy season
Clear during other season
Contains dissolved and suspended impurities of all kinds
Bacterial count may be very high.
Impurities
:
 Impurities are derived from surface washings, sewage and
sullage water, industrial wastes, and drainage from agriculture areas.
Tanks
:
 Tanks are large excavations in which surface water is stored.
They are important sources of water in some villages. Tanks are often
used for washing of cloths, cattle, humans, and cooking pots.
3. Groundwater
Groundwater is the cheapest and most practical means of providing water to
the communities. It is superior to surface water, because the ground itself

=== PAGE 115 ===
•
•

c.
provides an effective filtering medium.
Advantages
It is likely to be free from pathogenic agents.
It requires no treatment.
Disadvantages
It is high in mineral content (e.g. salts of calcium and magnesium).
It renders water hard.
It requires pumping.
Shallow wells
:
 Tap the water from above the first impervious layer in
the ground. Often grossly contaminated.
Deep wells
:
 Tap the water from below the first impervious layer in the
ground and it is pure.
Springs
:
 A spring is groundwater, which finds its way to the surface
because of certain topographical characteristics of the land. Four types
of springs are shallow, deep, mineral and thermal springs.

Purification of Water
Purification of water is of great importance in community. It is considered
under two headings:
Purification of water on a large scale.
Purification of water on a small scale.

Purification of Water on a Large Scale
1. Storage
Water is drawn out from the source and impounded in natural or artificial
reservoirs. Storage provides a reserve of water from which further pollution
is excluded. This is the natural method of purification.
Physical
:
 90% of suspended impurities settle down in 24 hours by
gravity. The water becomes clearer.
Chemical
:
 Certain chemical changes take place. As a result of storage,
the content of ammonia is reduced and rise in nitrates occurs.
Biological
:
 A tremendous drop of bacterial count occurs. The
pathogenic organisms die out.
If the water is stored for a long period, there is likelihood of growth of
algae which imparts bad smell and colour to the water.
2. Filtration
Two types of filters are used, the ‘biological’ or ‘slow sand’ filters and the
‘rapid sand’ or ‘mechanical’ filters.
a. Slow sand or biological filters
Elements of slow sand filters consists of:
Supernatant water.
A bed of graded sand
An under drainage system
A system of filter control valves.
Supernatant water
:
 The supernatant water above the sand bed serves
two important purposes; it provides a constant head of water and
secondly, it provides waiting period of some hours for the raw water to
undergo partial purification by sedimentation, oxidation and particle
agglomeration.
4b
Sand bed
:
 The most important part of the filter is the sand bed. The
sand should be clean and free from clay and organic matter. The sand

=== PAGE 118 ===

3.
bed presents a vast surface area. The water is subjected to mechanical
straining, sedimentation, adsorption, oxidation and bacterial action.
Vital layer
: When the filter is laid newly, it acts merely as a mechanical
strainer, and cannot truly be considered as “biological”. But very soon
the surface of the sand bed gets covered with a slimy growth known as
“schmutzdecke”, vital layer, zoogleal layer or biological layer. This
layer is slimy and gelatinous and consists of threadlike algae and
plankton, diatoms and bacteria. The formation of vital layer is known
as “ripening” of filter. It may take several days for the vital layer to
form. It extends 2 to 3 cm into the top portion of the sand bed. It is the
“heart” of the slow sand filter. It removes organic matter, holds back
bacteria and oxidizes ammonical nitrogen into nitrates and helps in
yielding bacteria-free water. Until the vital layer is formed fully, the
first few days filtrate is usually run to waste.
Under drainage system
:
 At the bottom of the filter bed is the under
drainage system. It consists of porous or perforated pipes which serve
the dual purpose of providing an outlet for filtered water, and
supporting the filter medium above.
Filter box
: The first three elements are contained in the filter box. The
filter box is an open box, usually rectangular in shape, from 2.5 to 4
metres deep and is built wholly or partly below ground. The walls may
be made of stone, brick or cement. The filter box consists from top to
bottom:
Supernatant water
1 to1.5 metres
Sand bed
1.2 metres
Gravel support
0.30 metres
Filter bottom
0.16 metres
Filter control
:
 The purpose of these devices is to maintain a steady rate
of filtration.
The advantages of slow sand filter are:
Simple to construct and operate.
The cost of construction is cheaper than that of rapid sand filters.
The physical, chemical and bacteriological quality of filtered
water is high.

=== PAGE 119 ===
4.

5.
They reduce total bacterial counts by 99.9 to 99.99%.
b. Rapid sand or mechanical filters
Rapid sand filters are of two types, the gravity type and the pressure type.
The following steps are involved in the purification of water by rapid sand
filters:
4b
Coagulation
:
 The raw water is first treated with chemical coagulant
such as alum, the dose of which varies from 5–40 milligrams or more
per litre, depending upon the turbidity and colour, temperature and pH
of water.
Rapid mixing
:
 The treated water is then subjected to violent agitation
in a “mixing chamber” for a few minutes.
Flocculation
:
 The next phase involves slow and gentle stirring of
treated water for 30 minutes in a “flocculation chamber”.
Sedimentation
:
 The coagulated water is then led into the sedimentation
tanks where it is detained for periods varying from 2 to 6 hours when
the flocculent precipitate together with impurities and bacteria settle
down in the tank.
Filtration
:
 The partly clarified water is now subjected to rapid sand
filtration.
Filtration
As the filtration proceeds, the suspended impurities and bacteria clog the
filters. The filters soon become dirty and begin to lose their efficiency. When
the “loss of head” approaches 7–8 feet, filtration is stopped and the filters are
subjected to a washing process known as “back washing.”
Back washing
Rapid sand filters needs frequent washing daily or weekly, depending upon
the loss of head. Washing is accomplished by reversing the flow of water
through the sand bed, which is called back washing. Back washing dislodges
the impurities and cleans the sand bed. Compressed air is used as part of the
back washing process.
Advantages

=== PAGE 120 ===

3.
The advantages of a rapid sand filters over the slow sand filters are:
Rapid sand filter can deal with raw water directly.
The filter bed occupies less space.
Filtration is rapid—40 to 50 times that of slow sand filters.
Washing of the filter is easy.
There is more flexibility in operation.
3. Chlorination
Chlorination is one of the greatest advances in water purification. It is
supplement, not a substitute to sand filtration. Chlorine kills pathogenic
bacteria, but it has no effect on spores and certain viruses except in high
doses. It oxidizes iron, manganese and hydrogen sulphide, it destroys some
taste and odour producing constituents, it controls algae and slime organisms,
and aids coagulation.
Action of chlorine
When chlorine is added to water, there is formation of hydrochloric and
hydrochlorous acids. The hydrochloric acid is neutralised by the alkalinity of
the water. The hypochlorous acid ionizes to form hydrogen ions and
hypochlorite ions.
The disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to the hypochlorous
acid, and to small extent due to hypochlorite ions. The hypo-chlorous acid is
the more effective (70–80 times) than the hypochlorite ions.
4a
Method of chlorination
For disinfecting large bodies of water, chlorine is applied either as,
Chlorine gas
Chloramine or
Perchloron.
Chlorine gas is the first choice, because it is cheap, quick in action,
efficient and easy to apply. Since chlorine gas is an irritant to the eyes and
poisonous, a special equipment known as “chlorinating equipment” is
required to apply chlorine gas to the water supplies.

=== PAGE 121 ===
1.
2.
Chloramines are loose compounds of chlorine and ammonia. They have
less tendency to produce chlorinous taste and give more persistent type of
residual chlorine. The greatest drawback of chloramine is that they have a
slower action than chlorine and, therefore, they are not being used to any
great extent in water treatment.
Perchloron or high test hypochlorite (HTH) is a calcium compound which
carries 60–70% of available chlorine. Solutions prepared from HTH are also
used for water disinfection.
Break point chlorination
When chlorine dose in the water is increased, a reduction in the residual
chlorine occurs. The end products do not represent any residual chlorine. This
fall in residual chlorine continues with further increase in chlorine dose, until
after a stage residual chlorine begin to increase in proportion. The point at
which it appears is called break point chlorination or dosage.

Double Pot Method
The double pot method has been devised by National Environmental
Engineering and Research Institute, Nagpur. This Method uses 2 cylindrical
pots one placed inside the other. The inside height and diameter of the outer
pot are 30 cm and 25 cm, respectively. A hole 1 cm in diameter is made in
each pot. In the inner pot, the hole is in the upper portion, near the rim and in
the outer pot it is 4 cm above the bottom (
Fig. 3.1
).


=== PAGE 123 ===
Fig. 3.1:
 Double pot method
A mixture of 1 kg of bleaching powder and 2 kg of coarse sand is
prepared and slightly moistened with water. The inner pot is filled with this
mixture up to 3 cm below the level of the hole. The inner pot is introduced
into the outer one and the mouth of the latter closed with polythene foil. The
double pot is lowered into the well by means of a rope. The pot should be
immersed at least 1 m below the water level to prevent damage by the
buckets used for drawing water. This method can be used satisfactory for 2–3
weeks in a well containing about 4500 litres of water.

Hardness of Water
Hardness may be defined as the soap-destroying power of water. The
hardness in water is caused mainly by four dissolved compounds. 
2
 These
are:
Calcium bicarbonates
Magnesium bicarbonates
Calcium sulfate
Magnesium sulfate.
Hardness is classified as carbonates and non-carbonates. The carbonate
hardness formerly designated as ‘temporary’ hardness is due to the presence
of calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The non-carbonate hardness
formerly designated as ‘permanent’ hardness is due to the presence of
calcium and magnesium sulfates.
Hardness in water is expressed in terms of ‘milliequivalents per
litre’(mEq/l).

Disadvantages of Hardness
Hardness in water consumes more soap and detergents.
When hard water is heated, the carbonates are precipitated and bring
about furring or scaling of boilers.
It affects cooking.
Fabrics washed in hard water with soap do not have a long life.

Water Pollution
Water is never pure in a chemical sense. It contains impurities of various
kinds—both dissolved and suspended impurities. These contain:
Dissolved gases, e.g. hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia,
nitrogen.
Dissolved minerals, e.g. salts of calcium, magnesium and sodium.
Suspended impurities, e.g. clay, silt, sand, mud, and microscopic plants
and animals.
Sources of Pollution
Sewages which contain decomposable organic matter and pathogenic
agents.
Industrial and trade wastes which contain toxic agents.
Agricultural pollutants which comprise fertilizers and pesticides.
Physical pollutants and radioactive substances.
Hazards of Water Pollution
The hazards of water pollution is classified into two broad groups—
biological and chemical.
Biological
:
 This includes water-borne diseases caused by the presence
of infective agent or an aquatic host in the water.
By the presence of infective agent:
Viral—viral hepatitis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis-E
Bacterial—cholera, typhoid, bacillary dysentry

II. Microbiological Aspects
a. Bacteriological indicators
Ideally, drinking water should not contain any microorganisms known to be
pathogenic. It should also be free from bacteria indicative of pollution with
excreta. Supplementary indicator organisms, such as faecal streptococci and
sulphite-reducing clostridia, may sometimes be useful in determining the
origin of faecal pollution as well as in assessing the efficiency of water

b. Virological aspects
Disinfection with 0.5 mg/l of free chlorine residual after contact period of at
least 30 minutes at a pH of 8.0 is sufficient to inactivate virus.
c. Biological aspects
Protozoa: Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia
 spp. and rarely, 
Balantidium
coli
. Standard methods are not currently available for the detection of
pathogenic protozoa in water supplies in the context of a routine
monitoring programme.
Helminths
:
 The methods for detection of parasitic roundworms and
flatworms are unsuited for routine monitoring.
Free-living organisms

supplies include fungi, algae, etc. The most common problem with
these are their interference in the operation of waste-treatment process,
colour, turbidity, taste and odour of finished water.
III. Chemical Aspects
The problem associated with chemical constituents of drinking water arises
primarily from their ability to cause adverse health effects after prolonged
periods of exposure; of particular concern are contaminants that have
cumulative toxic properties, such as heavy metals and substances that are
carcinogenic.
Health-related chemical constituents

IV. Radiological Aspects
Radioactivity in drinking water should not only be kept within safe limits; it
should also, within those limits, be kept as low as is reasonably possible.
The activity of a radioactive material is the number of nuclear
disintegration per unit of time. The unit of activity is a Becquerel (Bq); 1 Bq
= 1 disintegration per second. Formerly, the unit of activity was curie (Ci).
The proposed guideline values are:
Gross alpha activity 0.5 Bq/L
Gross beta activity 1.0 Bq/L.
Uses of Water
Water is used for many purposes.
Domestic uses
:
 Water is required for drinking, cooking, washing, and
bathing.
Public uses
:
 Water is required for public cleansing, fire fighting,

=== PAGE 133 ===

maintenance of public gardens, and swimming pools.
Industrial uses
:
 Iron and steel, paper industry for processing and
cooling.
Agricultural uses
:

Air Pollution
Air pollution is one of the present-day problems throughout the world.
Sources of Air Pollution
Automobiles
Industries
Domestic combustion of coal, wood or oil
Tobacco smoke
Miscellaneous such as burning refuse, incinerators, pesticide spraying,
wind-borne dust, fungi, moulds, etc.
Air Pollutants
More than 100 substances, which pollute air, have been identified. The
important ones are carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide,
sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide, nitrogen oxides, fluorine compounds,
organic compounds, metallic contaminants, radioactive compounds and
photochemical oxidants. Pollutants may be in the form of solids, liquids or
gases. The combination of smoke and fog is called ‘smog’.
Effects of Air Pollution
Air pollution can affect in two ways:
2
Health aspects
:
 The health effects of air pollution are both immediate
and delayed. The immediate effect borne by the respiratory system is
acute bronchitis. The delayed effects most commonly linked with air
pollution are chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, bronchial asthma,
emphysema, and respiratory allergies.
Social and economic aspects
:
 These comprise destruction of plant and
animal life; corrosion of metals; damage of buildings; cost of cleaning
and maintenance and repairs and aesthetic nuisance. Air pollution also
reduces visibility in towns.

WHO has recommended the following procedures for the prevention and
control of air pollution.
Containment
:
 Prevention of escape of toxic substances into ambient
air.
Replacement
:
 Replacing a technological process causing air pollution
by a new process that does not cause air pollution.
Dilution
:
 Dilution is valid so long as it is within the self-cleaning
capacity of the environment.
Legislation
:
 Air pollution is controlled in many countries by certain
legislation, e.g. clean air acts.
International action
:
 To monitor and study the air pollution.
In recent years, disinfection of air has received much attention. The methods
employed are:
Mechanical ventilation
Ultraviolet radiation.
Chemical mists.
Dust control.

=== PAGE 137 ===
NOISE
Noise is often defined as “unwanted sound”. A better definition of noise is:
‘wrong sound, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.’
3

=== PAGE 138 ===
Sources
The sources of noise are many and varied. These are automobiles, factories,
industries, air-craft, etc. Noise levels are acute near railway junctions, traffic
roundabouts, bus terminuses and airports. Domestic noises form the radios,
transistors, TV sets.

Effects of Noise Exposure
The effects of noise exposure are of two types—auditory and non-auditory.
Auditory Effects
Auditory fatigue causing whistling and buzzing in the ears.
Deafness.
Non-auditory Effects
Interference with speech.
Annoyance.
Physiological changes—rise in blood pressure, an increase in heart
rate, a rise in intracranial pressure, giddiness, nausea and fatigue.
Efficiency—reduction in noise has been found to increase work output.

DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTES
The term “solid waste” is applied to unwanted or discarded waste material
from houses, street sweeping, commercial, industrial and agricultural
operations, arising from man’s activities. In the cities, it is called refuse; in
the countryside, it is called litter; and in general, it is called solid wastes.

Health Aspects
The accumulation of solid wastes in man’s environment constitutes a positive
health hazard because of the following reasons:
4d
The organic portion of solid wastes ferments and favours fly breeding.
The garbage in the refuse attracts rats.
The pathogens may be conveyed to man through flies and dust.
There is possibility of water pollution, if rain, water passes through
deposits of fermenting refuse.
There is risk of air pollution, if there is accidental or spontaneous
combustion of refuse.
Piles of refuse are a nuisance from an aesthetic point of view.

Sources of Refuse
Street refuse
:
 Refuse that is collected by the street cleansing service or
scavenging is called street refuse. It consists of leaves, straw, paper,
animal droppings and litter of all kinds.
Market refuse
:
 Refuse collected from markets is called market refuse.
It contains a large portion of putrid vegetable and animal matter.
Stable litter
:
 Refuse collected from stables are stable litter and it
contains mainly animal droppings and left over animal feeds.
Industrial refuse
:
 It comprises of wastes ranging from completely inert
materials such as calcium carbonate to highly toxic and explosive
compounds.
Domestic refuse
:
 It consists of ash, rubbish and garbage.
Ash is the residue from fire used for cooking and heating. Rubbish
comprise of wood bits, paper, clothing, metal, glass, dirt and dust. Garbage
consists of waste food, vegetable peeling and organic matter. It needs quick
removal and disposal because it ferments on storage.

Methods of Disposal
There is no single method of refuse disposal in all circumstances. The choice
of a particular method is governed by local factors such as cost and
availability of land and labour. The principal methods of refuse disposal are:
3
Dumping
Controlled tipping or sanitary land-fill
Incineration
Composting
Manure pits
Burial
a. Dumping
Refuse is dumped in low lying areas partly as a method of reclamation of
land but mainly as an easy method of disposal of dry refuse. As a result of
bacterial action, refuse decreases considerably in volume and is converted
gradually into humus. The drawback of open dumping are: (1) the refuse is
exposed to flies and rodents, (2) it is the source of nuisance from the site of
smell and unsightly appearance, (3) the loose refuse is dispersed by the action
of wind and (4) drainage from dumps contributes to the pollution of surface
water and groundwater.
b. Controlled Tipping
Controlled tipping or sanitary landfill is the most satisfactory method of
refuse disposal where suitable land is available. The material is placed in a
trench or other prepared area, adequately compacted, and covered with earth
at the end of working day. The term “modified sanitary landfill” has been
applied to those operations where compaction and covering are accomplished
once or twice a week. Three methods are used in this operation.
The trench method
:
 Where level ground is available the trench method
is used. A long trench is dug out 2–3 m deep and 4–12 m wide. The
refuse is compacted and covered with excavated earth.
The ramp method
:
 This method is well suited where the terrain is

=== PAGE 145 ===
3.

2.
moderately sloping. Some excavation is done to secure the covering
material.
The area method
:
 This method is used for land depressions, disused
quarries and clay pits. The refuse is deposited, packed and consolidated
in uniform layers up to 2 to 2.5 m deep.
Each layer is sealed on its exposed surface with mud cover at least 30 cm
thick. Such sealing prevents infestation by flies and rodents and suppresses
the nuisance of smell and dust. This method often has the disadvantage of
requiring supplemental earth from outside sources.
c. Incineration
Refuse can be disposed of hygienically by burning or incineration. It is the
best method where suitable land is not available. Hospital refuse is disposed
by this method. The refuse is reduced to one-fourth its original weight and
the residue is called “clinker” which is used for road making after mixing
with lime.
1
 The incinerator consists of:
A furnace or combustion chamber maintained at over 1200°C.
A platform for tipping the refuse.
Stokers for raking the refuse forward.
Baffle plate to drive out all fumes.
Types
Double cell meldrum
Single cell destructors
The chief advantage is that the cost of carting is minimized.
Disadvantages
Expensive
Moisture presence during rainy season affects burning of refuse.
d. Composting
Composting is a method of combined disposal of refuse and night soil and
sludge. It is a process of nature whereby organic matter breaks down under

=== PAGE 146 ===
1.
2.
bacterial action resulting in the formation of relatively stable humuslike
material, called the compost which has considerable manurial value for soil.
The end-product—compost—contains few or no disease-producing
organisms, and is a good soil builder containing small amounts of the major
plant nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates. The following methods of
composting are now used:
Bangalore method (Anaerobic method)
:
 It is also called the hot
fermentation process. It has been recommended as a satisfactory
method of disposal of town wastes and night soil. Trenches are dug 3 ft
deep, 5–8 ft broad and 15–30 ft long. It should be located not less than
½ mile from city limits. First a layer of refuse about 6 inches thick is
spread at the bottom of the trench. Over this, night soil is added
corresponding to a thickness of 2 inches. Then alternate layers of
refuse and night soil are added in the proportion of 6 inches and 2
inches respectively, till the heap rises to 1 ft above the ground level.
The top layer should be of refuse, at least 9 inches thickness. Then the
heap is covered with excavated earth. Within 7 days, as a result of
bacterial action, considerable heat is generated in the compost mass.
This heat persists for 2 or 3 weeks, and serves to decompose the refuse
and night soil and to destroy all pathogenic and parasitic organisms. At
the end of 4 to 6 months, decomposition is complete and the resulting
manure is well-decomposed, odourless, innocuous material of high
manurial value ready for application to the land.
Mechanical composting (aerobic method)
:
 Another method of
composting becoming popular is the mechanical composting. In this,
compost is literally manufactured on a large scale by processing raw
materials and turning out into a finished product. The refuse is first
cleared of salvable materials such as rags, bones, metal glass, and
items, which are rendered to interfere in grinding. It is then pulverized
in pulverizing equipment in order to reduce the size of particles to less
than 2 inches. The pulverized refuse is then mixed with sewage, sludge
or night soil in a rotating machine and incubated. The entire process of
composting is complete in 4 to 6 weeks.
e. Manure Pits
The problem of refuse disposal in rural areas can be solved by digging

=== PAGE 147 ===
‘manure pits’ by the individual householders. The garbage, cattle dung, straw
and leaves should be dumped into the manure pits and covered with earth
after each day’s dumping. In 5 to 6 months time, the refuse is converted into
manure which can be returned to the field. This method of refuse disposal is
effective and relatively simple in rural communities.
f. Burial
This method is suitable for small camps. A trench 1.5 m wide and 2 m deep is
excavated and at the end of each day the refuse is covered with 20 to 30 cm
of earth. When the level in the trench is 40 cm from ground level, the trench
is filled with earth and compacted, and a new trench is dug out. The contents
may be taken out after 4 to 6 months and used on the fields.

OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS
Occupational health
 is essentially preventive medicine. The joint ILO/WHO
Committee gave the following, “occupational health should aim at the
promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and
social well-being of workers in all occupations.”
2
An industrial worker may be exposed to five types of hazards, depending
upon the occupations:
Physical hazards
Chemical hazards
Biological hazards
Mechanical hazards
Psychosocial hazards

=== PAGE 152 ===
Physical Hazards
a. Heat and Cold
The common physical hazard in most industries is heat. The direct effect of
heat exposure are burns, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and heat cramps. The
indirect effects are decreased efficiency, increased fatigue and enhanced
accident rates. Important hazards associated with cold work are chilblains,
erythrocyanosis, immersion foot, and frostbite as a result of cutaneous
vasoconstriction.
b. Light
The acute effects of poor illumination are eyestrain, headache, eye pain,
lachrymation, congestion around the cornea, and the chronic effects on health
includes “miner’s nystagmus”.
Table 3.6:
 
Physical hazards in dentistry and their prevention strategies

=== PAGE 153 ===
Exposure to excessive brightness is associated with discomfort, annoyance

=== PAGE 154 ===
and visual fatigue.
c. Noise
Auditory effects which consist of temporary or permanent hearing loss. Non-
auditory effects which consist of nervousness, fatigue, interference with
speech.
d. Vibration
Vibration affects hands and arms. After some months or years of exposure,
the fine blood vessels of the fingers may be increasingly sensitive to spasm.
e. Ultraviolet Radiation
Occupational exposure to ultraviolet radiation occurs mainly in arc welding.
Such radiation affects the eye, causing intense conjunctivitis and keratitis.
f. Ionizing Radiation
Ionizing radiations are finding increased application in medicine and
industry. X-rays and radioactive isotopes are widely used. The radiation
hazards comprise of genetic changes, malformation, cancer, leukaemia,
ulceration and sterility and in extreme cases the death (
Table 3.7
).
Table 3.7:
 
Radiation hazards in dentistry and their prevention strategies


=== PAGE 155 ===
1.
Chemical Hazards
Chemical agents act in three ways—local action, inhalation, and ingestion
(
Table 3.8
).
Table 3.8:
 
Chemical hazards in dentistry and their prevention strategies
a. Local Action
Some chemicals are absorbed through the skin and cause systemic effects.
Occupational dermatitis are due to machine oil, rubber, X-rays, caustic
alkalies and lime.
b. Inhalation
Gases
:
 Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanide gas, sulphur
dioxide, etc. cause gas poisoning.

=== PAGE 156 ===
2.
3.
Dusts
:
 Inorganic dusts, such as coal dust, silica, asbestos, iron, cause
anthracosis, silicosis, asbestosis, cancer lung, siderosis. Organic dusts
such as cane fibre, cotton dust, tobacco, hay or grain dust. Causes
bagassosis, byssinosis, tobacossis and farmer’s lung.
Metals and their compounds
:
 Toxic hazards occur from lead, mercury,
cadmium, manganese, arsenic, chromium, etc.
c. Ingestion
Occupational diseases may also result from ingestion of chemical substances
such as lead, mercury, arsenic, zinc, cadmium, phosphorous, etc.

=== PAGE 157 ===
Biological Hazards
Worker may be exposed to infective and parasitic agents at the place of work.
The occupational diseases include leptospirosis, anthrax, tetanus, hydatidosis,
fungal infections, etc. (
Table 3.9
).
Table 3.9:
 
Biological hazards in dentistry and their prevention strategies


=== PAGE 158 ===
Mechanical Hazards
The mechanical hazards in industry centre around machinery, protruding
moving parts and the like. About 10% of accidents in industry are said to be
due to mechanical causes.

=== PAGE 159 ===
Psychosocial Hazards
The psychosocial hazards arise from the worker’s failure to adapt to an alien
psychosocial environment. Frustrations, lack of job satisfaction, insecurity,
emotional tension are some of the psychosocial factors that undermine the
physical and mental health of the workers.

Nutrition in Health
and Disease
Oral tissues, like all other tissues in the human body, are dependent on their
trophic environment to supply the nutrients essential for growth, development
and maintenance of health. Nutrients in the diet can influence oral disease in
the following ways.
5
Modifying the biochemical environment of cells responsible for
formation of tissues such as enamel.
Altering the biosynthetic reactions (proteins and lipids).
Altering the quantity and flow of saliva and its physical, chemical or
immunologic properties.
Influencing implantation, colonisation and metabolic activity of plaque
flora on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice.

=== PAGE 162 ===
Definition
Nutrition may be defined as the science of food and its relationship to health.
It is concerned primarily with the part played by nutrients in body growth,
development and maintenance.
3
Good nutrition means, “maintaining a nutritional status that enables us to
grow well and enjoy good health.”

=== PAGE 163 ===

Nutrients
Nutrients are organic and inorganic complexes contained in food. They are
divided into
Macronutrients
:
 Proteins, fats, carbohydrates are called as
macronutrients because they form the main bulk of food.
Proteins
7–15%
Fats
10–30%
Carbohydrates
65–80%
Micronutrients
:
 Vitamins, minerals. They are called micronutrients
because they are required in small amounts.

1. PROTEINS
Proteins are complex organic nitrogenous compounds. They are composed of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur in varying amounts. Proteins
are made up of smaller units called amino acids. There are essential and non-
essential amino acids. Essential amino acids have important biological
functions, e.g. formation of niacin from tryptophan. New tissues cannot be
formed unless all the essential amino acids are present in the diet.
3
Non-essential amino acids include arginine, asparaginic acid, serine,
glutamic acid, proline and glycine.
Sources
Animal source
:
 Milk, meat, eggs, cheese, fish and fowl.
Vegetable source
:
 Pulses, cereals, beans, nuts, oil-seed cakes.
Functions
Proteins are needed by the body for:
Body building

2. FATS
Fats are solid at 20°C. They are called “oils”, if they are liquid at the
temperature. Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy. Fats yield fatty
acids and glycerol on hydrolysis. Fatty acids are divided into saturated fatty
acids and unsaturated fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are those that cannot be
synthesized by humans. The most important essential fatty acid is linoleic
acid.
Source
Animal fats
:
 Ghee, butter, milk, cheese, eggs and fat of meat and fish.
Vegetable fats
:
 Ground nut, mustard, sesame, coconut. They are sources of
vegetable oils.
Functions
They are high energy foods thus provide energy.
Serve as vehicles for fat-soluble vitamins.
Fats in the body support viscera such as heart, kidney and intestine.
Essential fatty acids are needed by body for growth, for structural
integrity of cell membrane and decreased platelet adhesiveness.
Fats and Disease
Obesity
:
 A diet rich in fat can pose a threat to human health by
encouraging obesity (
Fig. 4.2
).
Phrenoderma
:
 Deficiency of essential fatty acids in the diet is
associated with rough and dry skin.

Dietary Goals
4
The dietary goals (Prudent diet) recommended by the various expert
committees of WHO are as below:
Dietary fat should be limited to approximately 15–30% of total daily
intake.
Saturated fats should contribute no more than 10% of the total energy
intake; unsaturated vegetable oils should be substituted for the
remaining fat requirement.
Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrate should be avoided;
some amount of carbohydrate rich in natural fibre should be taken.
Sources rich in energy such as fats and alcohol should be restricted.
Salt intake should be reduced to an average of not more than 5 g per
day; (salt intake is more in tropical countries. In India, it averages 15 g
per day).
Protein should account for approximately 10–15% of the daily intake.
Junk foods such as colas, ketchups and other foods that supply empty
calories, should be reduced.

My PYRAMID
7
MyPyramid
, released by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) on April 19, 2005, is an update on the American food guide
pyramid. The new icon stresses activity and moderation along with a proper
mix of food groups in one’s diet. Significant changes from the previous food
pyramid include (
Fig. 4.6
):
Fig. 4.6:
 MyPyramid
Inclusion of a new symbol
—a person on the stairs—representing
physical activity. Measuring quantities in cups and ounces instead of
servings.
MyPyramid contains eight divisions. From left to right on the pyramid
are a person and six food groups.
Physical activity
, represented by a person climbing steps on the
pyramid, to illustrate moderate physical activity every day, in addition
to usual activity. The 
key recommendations
 for 2005 (other specific
recommendations are provided for children and adolescents, pregnant
and breastfeeding women, for older adults and for weight maintenance)
are:

=== PAGE 194 ===
–
–
Engage in regular physical activity and reduce sedentary
activities to promote health, psychological well-being, and a
healthy body weight. (At least 30 minutes on most, and if
possible, every day for adults and at least 60 minutes each day
for children and teenagers, and for most people increasing to
more vigorous-intensity or a longer duration will bring greater
benefits.)
Achieve physical fitness by including cardiovascular
conditioning, stretching exercises for flexibility, and resistance
exercises or calisthenics for muscle strength and endurance.

DIET COUNSELLING
8
It deals with providing guidance in the art of food planning and food
preparation and food services.
It assists a person to adjust food consumption to his or her health
needs.
Diet diary
:
 It is a 3-, 5-, 7-day record in which the client records all
foods and drinks consumed within the defined period. If the 24-hour
diet history sweet score and dental health diet score indicate the need
for nutritional counselling, the dental hygienists ask the client to
complete a 3-, 5-, 7-day diet diary. A food diary that includes a
weekend is more likely to represent the individual’s normal eating
habits. All foods consumed in a 24-hour period should be recorded
including type of food eaten, manner in which it was prepared, exact
amount of each food eaten, and time of day in which eaten. The client
should be encouraged to adhere to his or her normal diet regimen
during assessment period.
Diet history evaluation
:
 The patient’s 5-day diary is analysed for (1)
adequacy of intake of food from all the food groups. (2) The amount
and type of food sweetened with sugar and the frequency of eating
them.
The patient is asked to do the following:
Step 1
: Circle in red all the foods in the 5-day diary that are
sweetened with sugar. This includes concentrated forms of
sweets such as dried fruits.
Step 2
: The total number of exposures of the teeth to sweets,
their form and when they were eaten are determined. This value
is multiplied by 20. 20 denote the number of minutes the teeth
are subjected to acid demineralization after each, sugar
consumption.
Step
 3: The adequacy of the diet in terms of the desirable
number of servings of each of the food groups is determined.
Dental health diet score
:
 The dental health diet score gives points
earned as a result of an adequate intake of foods from each of the food

=== PAGE 196 ===
groups plus points for ingesting foods especially recommended
because they are the best sources of the ten nutrients essential for
achieving and maintaining dental health. From this sum, points are
subtracted for frequent ingestion of foods that are overtly sweet—
whose sweetness is derived from added refined sugar or concentrated
natural sugars. The difference is the dental health diet score. A score of
60 to 100 is acceptable and dietary counselling is not usually given
unless the patient requests it. If the sum points are 56 or less,
counselling is indicated.

Steps in Calculating a Dental Health Diet Score
Step 1
: To ascertain the average daily intake, everything one eats and
drinks on an ordinary weekday including snacks is listed. The time of
meal or snack consumption, the method of food preparation and the
number of teaspoons of sugar added are noted.
Step 2
: Circle the foods in the diary that have been sweetened with
added sugar or concentrated natural sweets. Classify the encircled
foods or mixed foods into one of the appropriate food groups.
For each of the foods listed in the food intake dairy, place a
check mark in the appropriate food group block.
Add the number of checks and multiply by the number shown.
The maximum number of point’s credit for the milk and meat
group is 24 each and for the fruit vegetable bread cereal group is
24 each.
Add the points. The sum is the food group score. 96 are the
highest score.
Step 3
: In each of the 8 columns of food, check the one or more eaten
on this weekday. If a food is checked, circle the number (7) beside the
nutrient that heads the column. The same food such as broccoli, may be
found in several columns also, in a column more than one food may be
checked. Regardless of the number of times, the score of seven is given
only once. 56 is the perfect score. Add the numbers circled to obtain
the nutrient score.
Step 4
: List the sweets and sugar sweetened foods and the frequency
with which they are consumed in a typical day.
Classify each sweet into the liquid, solid and sticky, or slowly
dissolving category.
Place a check mark in the frequency column for each item as
long as they are eaten at least 20 minutes apart.
Add the number of checks. If the sweets are liquid, multiply by
5. If solid, multiply by 10 and if slow dissolving, multiply by 15.
Write the products in the point’s column and total them. This is
the sweet score.

=== PAGE 198 ===
•
Step 5
: Now put it all together. If the 4 food groups score is barely
adequate or not adequate and or the sweet score is in the watch out
zone—nutrition counselling is indicated.

NUTRITIONAL PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
There are many nutritional problems, which affect vast segments of our
populations.

3.
1. Low Birth Weight
Low birth weight (i.e. birth weight less than 2500 g) is a major public health
problem. About 30% of babies born in India have low birth weight.
Causes of Low Birth Weight
Maternal malnutrition and anaemia
Physical labour during pregnancy
Illness especially infection, etc.

=== PAGE 201 ===
1.
2.
3.
2. Protein Energy Malnutrition
It has been identified as a major health and nutrition problem in India.
1
 The
current concept of PEM is its clinical forms—kwashiorkor and marasmus.
Protein energy malnutrition was due to protein deficiency.
Causes
Inadequate intake of food both in quantity and quality.
Infections notably diarrhoea, respiratory infections, measles, etc.
Other contributory factors are poor environmental conditions, large
family size, poor maternal health, failure of lactation, premature
termination of breastfeeding.

=== PAGE 202 ===
3. Xerophthalmia
It refers to all the ocular manifestations of vitamin A deficiency in man.
Xerophthalmia is most common in children aged 1–3 years, and is often
related to weaning. The younger the child, the more severe the disease. The
victims belong to the poorest families.

=== PAGE 203 ===

4. Nutritional Anaemia
Nutritional anaemia is a disease syndrome caused by malnutrition in its
widest sense.
It has been defined by WHO as “a condition in which the haemoglobin
content of blood is lower than normal as a result of a deficiency of one or
more essential nutrients regardless of the cause of such deficiency.”
6
Causes
Iron deficiency
Frequently folate or vitamin B

5. Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)
Iodine deficiency is yet another major nutrition problem in India.
1
 Iodine
deficiency was equated with goitre (
Fig. 4.7
).
Fig. 4.7:
 Deficiency of iodine—goitre
The most obvious consequence of iodine deficiency is goitre. There is
much wider spectrum of disorders such as:
Hypothyroidism.
Retarded physical development.
Impaired mental function.
Increased rate of spontaneous abortion.
Neurological cretinism.
Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) refers to all the effects of iodine
deficiency on human growth and development, which can be prevented by
correction of iodine deficiency.

=== PAGE 205 ===
6. Endemic Fluorosis
In many parts of the world, where drinking water contains excessive amounts
of fluorine, endemic fluorosis has been observed.
a. Dental Fluorosis
Fluorosis of dental enamel which occurs when excess fluoride is ingested
during the years of tooth calcification is characterized by “mottling” of dental
enamel.
Teeth lose their shiny appearance and chalky-white patches develop on
them. White patches become yellow and sometimes brown or black.
In severe cases, loss of enamel gives the tooth a corroded appearance.
Mottling is best seen on the incisors of the upper jaw.
b. Skeletal Fluorosis
There is heavy deposition of fluoride in the skeleton. When a concentration
of 10 mg/l is exceeded, crippling fluorosis can ensue leading to permanent
disability.
c. Genu Valgum
A new form of fluorosis characterized by genu valgum and osteoporosis of
lower limits.

=== PAGE 206 ===
7. Lathyrism
It is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals.
In humans—neurolathyrism affecting nervous system.
In animals—osteolathyrism resulting in skeletal deformities because of
pathological changes occurring in bones.

Conclusion
Oral health cannot be exclusively maintained through one approach, i.e.
through nutritional guidance, dietary manipulations, chemo-thrapeutic agents,
or restorative procedures. The chances for preserving oral health, however,
are improved by lifelong disciplined dedication of the individuals who
understands the benefits to be derived from the combined effects of oral
hygiene, fluorides, and adequate nutrition and diet and who incorporates this
knowledge into their daily habits.

CHAPTER

Health Education
Health education is the profession of educating people about health.
1
 It
involves a combination of learning experiences designed to help individuals
and communities improve their health, by increasing their knowledge or
influencing their attitudes.
Health education is the very foundation of every successful public health
programme, thus is an essential part of community health, which is vital to
the practice of prevention. The purpose of health education is to positively
influence the health behaviour of individuals and communities as well as the
living and working conditions that influence their health. Health education
aims at bridging the gulf between the health knowledge and health practices
among people.

=== PAGE 216 ===
Definition
Health education in simple can be defined as the principle by which
individuals and groups of people learn to behave in a manner conducive to
the promotion, maintenance, or restoration of health. However, there is no
single acceptable definition of health education, a variety of definitions exist.
The Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology of
2001 defined health education as any combination of planned learning
experiences based on sound theories that provide individuals, groups, and
communities the opportunity to acquire information and the skills needed to
make quality health decisions.
2
The most accepted and adopted definition given by the National
Conference on Preventive Medicine [1997] in USA defines, “Health
education is a process that informs, motivates and helps people to adopt and
maintain healthy practices and lifestyles, advocates environmental changes as
needed to facilitate the goal and conducts professional training and research
to the same end.”
3
World Health Organization
 defines it as “any combination of learning
opportunities and teaching activities designed to facilitate voluntary
adaptations of behaviours, that are conducive to health”.

Changing Concepts
The declaration of Alma-Ata (1978) emphasized the need for “individual and
community participation” which gave a new meaning and direction to the
practice of health education. Historically, health education has been
committed to disseminating information and changing human behaviour.
Following the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978 emphasis has shifted from:
Prevention of disease to promotion of healthy lifestyles.
Modification of individual behaviour to modification of social
environment in which the individual lives.
Community participation to community involvement.

OBJECTIVES
The three main objectives of health education are:
Informing the people
:
 The primary objective of health education is to
inform the people or provide scientific knowledge about prevention of
disease and promotion of health. Exposure to knowledge will melt
away the barriers of ignorance, prejudices, and misconceptions, people
may have about health and disease.

Motivating people
:
 Informing people about health is not merely
enough. They must be motivated to change their habits and the ways of
living, since many present day problems of community health require
alteration of human behaviour or changes in health practices which are
detrimental to health, like pollution of water, cigarette smoking,
physical activity, etc. The accent should be on motivating the
“consumer” to make his own decision and choices about health
matters, i.e. what kind of health actions to be taken, and when and
under what conditions to take them.
Guiding into action
:
 People need help to adopt and maintain healthy
practices and lifestyles, which may be totally new to them.
Governments have a major responsibility to provide the necessary
infrastructure of health services. People need to be encouraged “to use
judiciously and wisely the health services available to them”.
3
Governments are now beginning to realize that the services and
facilities they provide to improve the socioeconomic and health status
of the people will not be fully effective unless the people not only
make use of the services but also undertake various practical self-help
measures to improve their own health status and the communities in
which they live in.
However, the final aim of health education is to make realistic
improvements in the basic quality of life of people.

APPROACH TO HEALTH EDUCATION
There are basically four well-known approaches to health education. They
are: (a) Regulatory or legal approach, (b) administrative or service approach,
(c) educational approach and the recent, (d) primary health care approach.
Regulatory approach
:
 The regulatory or legal approach seeks to
protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and
regulations, e.g. Food Adulteration Act, Epidemic Diseases Act, etc.
The major disadvantage with this approach is that it requires is a vast
administrative machinery to enforce laws and also involves
considerable expenditure. Another is it becomes useful only at certain
times or in restricted situations.
Service approach
:
 This approach aims at providing all the health
facilities needed by the community in the hope that people would use
them to improve their own health. It proved a failure when it was not
based on the “felt needs” of the people.
Educational approach
:
 This approach is one of the major means for
achieving change in health practices and the recognition of health
needs in the modern world. It involves motivation, communication and
decision-making. The results, although slow, are permanent and
enduring.
Primary health care approach
:
 This is a new approach starting from
the people with their full participation and active involvement. The
underlying objective is to help individuals to become self-reliant in
matters of health. This, in turn, can be done, if the people receive the
necessary guidance from health care providers in identifying their
health problems and finding workable solutions.

Health Education and Propaganda
Health education and propaganda are not the same. They differ in a number
of characteristics. Propaganda involves mainly publicity, whereas education
is a process that facilitates the act of learning. The differences between these
two drawn by the 
Central Health Education Bureau, Government of India
are listed in 
Table 5.1
.
Table 5.1:
 
Differences between health education and propaganda
Health education
Propaganda or publicity
Knowledge and skills actively
acquired
Knowledge instilled in the minds of
the people
Makes people think for
themselves
Prevents thinking with the
availability of readymade slogans
Disciplines primitive desires
Arouses and stimulates primitive
desires
Develops reflective behaviour
Trains people to use judgment
before acting
Develops reflexive behaviour
Trains people to aim at impulsive
actions
Appeals to reason
Appeals to emotion
Develops individuality,
personality and self-expression
Develops different patterns of
attitude and behaviours according to
the medium used
Knowledge acquired through
and self-reliant activity
Knowledge passively received and
spoon fed
The process is behaviour
centred – aims at developing
favourable attitudes, habits and
skills
The process is information centred –
no change in individual’s attitude or
behaviour

=== PAGE 221 ===
MODELS OF HEALTH EDUCATION
Medical Model
This model is primarily based in the recognition and treatment of disease
curing and technological advancements to facilitate the process.
The assumption was people would act on the information provided by
health professional to improve their health. However, since this model did not
take into consideration the social, cultural and psychological factors and
hence could not bridge the gap between knowledge and behaviour.

=== PAGE 222 ===
Motivation Model
It was noticed that mere provision of health information to people did not
bring about any significant changes; hence health education started
emphasizing “motivation” as the main force to translate health information to
the desired health action.

=== PAGE 223 ===
Social Intervention Model
With rising public health problems being faced in today’s world, it was
impractical for the earlier approaches to achieve any behavioural changes. It
was realized that in many instances, it is not the individual who needs to be
changed but the social environment which shapes the behaviour of the
individual and the community.
An effective health education model should be based on the precise
knowledge of human ecology and understanding of the interaction between
the cultural, biological, physical and socio-environmental factors.

=== PAGE 224 ===
CONTENTS OF HEALTH EDUCATION
The scope of health education extends beyond the conventional health sector.
It covers every aspect of family and community health. While no definite
training curricula can be proposed, the content of health education may be
divided into the following divisions for the sake of simplicity.

=== PAGE 225 ===
Human Biology
Understanding health, demands an understanding of the human biology. The
best place to teach human biology is the school, through its sequential health
curriculum which can provide continuous in-depth learning experience for
millions of students, as teaching of human biology starts from the lower
classes itself. The provision of information and advice on human biology and
hygiene is vital for each new generation.

=== PAGE 226 ===
Nutrition
The aim of educating people about nutrition is to inform them the importance
of optimum and balanced diet. It also is a major intervention for the
prevention of malnutrition, promotion of health and improving the quality of
life.

=== PAGE 227 ===
a.
b.
Hygiene
The people are taught about the importance of hygiene and methods of
maintaining hygiene. The teaching of hygiene has two aspects:
Personal hygiene
:
 The aim is to promote good standards of personal
cleanliness within the surroundings where the people live. Measures of
basic hygiene are taught here like bathing, washing, keeping good
personal appearance, etc.
Environmental hygiene
:
 This comprises of two aspects—domestic and
community.
The domestic hygiene includes keeping the house and its surroundings
clean, proper ventilation, adequate light and fresh air, proper disposal of
waste materials, avoidance of pests, insects, etc.
The community hygiene includes the care of the surroundings where the
person lives in, proper channels for waste disposal, avoidance of water
stagnation, etc.

=== PAGE 228 ===
Family Health
The main aim is to strengthen and improve the health of the family as a unit
rather than as an individual. Currently the focus has been mainly with regard
to maternal and child health care, family planning, immunization, nutrition
and other health, related activities.

=== PAGE 229 ===
Disease Prevention and Control
The aim is to provide knowledge about the nature of communicable and non-
communicable diseases and methods of preventing them. People must be
encouraged to actively participate in programmes directed towards disease
prevention, health protection and promotion.

=== PAGE 230 ===
Mental Health
The aim is to help people to be mentally healthy and to prevent a mental
breakdown. There are certain situations when mental health is of great
importance—mother after child birth, child at entry into school for the first
time, decision about a future career, starting a new family and at the time of
widowhood. These are critical periods of life when external pressure tends to
breakdown mental health. Health workers should help people achieve mental
health by showing sympathy, understanding, and by social contact.

=== PAGE 231 ===
Prevention of Accidents
Accidents have become a major feature of modern human life. People have to
be taught on the prevention of accidents, which takes place in their homes, in
their work place or on the road.

=== PAGE 232 ===
Use of Health Services
Individuals have to be educated and informed about the various health
services and preventive programmes available to them. The community
should always be encouraged to participate in various health education and
preventive programmes.

PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH EDUCATION
Health education is a social science that draws its content mainly from
biological, environmental, psychological, physical and medical sciences. The
main principles of health education include:
Credibility
Interest
Participation
Motivation
Comprehension
Reinforcement
Learning by doing
Known to unknown
Setting an example
Soil, seed and sower
Good human relations
Social leaders
Feedback

=== PAGE 234 ===
Credibility
It is the degree to which the message to be communicated is perceived as
trustworthy by the receiver. Unless the people have trust and confidence in
the communicator, no desired action will ensue after receiving the message.

=== PAGE 235 ===
Interest
Health education should be related to the interest of the people. If a health
programme is based on “felt needs”, people will gladly participate in the
programme and only then it will be a people’s programme.

=== PAGE 236 ===
Participation
It is a key word in health education. People should be encouraged to be a part
of the health education programme. Participation is based on psychological
principle of active learning; it is better than passive learning. Group
discussion, panel discussion, workshop all provide opportunities for active
learning.

=== PAGE 237 ===
•
•
Motivation
All individuals have a desire to learn. Awakening this desire is called
motivation. There are of two types:
Primary
: These are inborn desires which initiate people to take action,
e.g. hunger, survival, etc.
Secondary
: These motives are based on desires created by external
forces or incentives, e.g. praise, reward, etc.
In health education, we make use of motivation to change behaviour.
Motivation is contagious; once motivated person may spread motivation
throughout the group.

=== PAGE 238 ===
Comprehension
In health education, we must know the level of understanding, education and
literacy of people to whom the teachings are directed. One barrier to
communication is using words, which cannot be understood. We should
always communicate in the language people understand, and never use
words, which are strange and new to them. Teaching should be within the
mental capacity of the audience.

=== PAGE 239 ===
Reinforcement
Learning new things in a single period is difficult. This requires constant
repetition. It is like a booster dose. This is because constant reinforcement
leaves a stronger impression on mind and helps to understand and accept new
principles.

=== PAGE 240 ===
Learning by Doing
Learning is an action process; not a memorizing one in a narrow sense. The
Chinese proverb “if I hear, I forget; if I see, I remember; if I do; I know”
illustrates the importance of learning by doing.

=== PAGE 241 ===
Known to Unknown
In health education work, we proceed from the known to unknown, i.e. start
where the people are and with what they understand and then proceed to new
knowledge. New knowledge will bring about a new, enlarged understanding,
which can give rise to an insight into the problem.

=== PAGE 242 ===
Setting an Example
The health educator himself should set a good example in the things he is
teaching which will help people to look upon him and lead a healthy lifestyle.

=== PAGE 243 ===
Soil, Seed and Sower
In the context of health education, soil refers to people to whom education is
given. Seed refers to the health facts to be given to the people. The health
facts must be truthful and based on scientific knowledge. Sower refers to the
transmitting media. The transmitting media should be attractive, palatable
and acceptable.

=== PAGE 244 ===
Good Human Relations
Good human relations are of utmost importance in learning. The health
educator must be kind and sympathetic.

=== PAGE 245 ===

Leaders
We learn best from people whom we respect and regard. In the work of
health education, we try to penetrate the community through the local leaders
—the village headman, the school teacher or the political worker. If the
leaders are convinced first about the programme the task of implementing the
programme will be easy.
The attributes of a leader are
:
He understands the needs and demands of the community
Provides proper guidance
Takes the initiative
Is receptive to the views and suggestions of the people
Self-less, honest, impartial, considerate and sincere
Easily accessible to the people
Able to control and compromise the various fractions in the community
Possesses the requisite skill and knowledge of eliciting cooperation and
achieving coordination of the various official and nonofficial
organizations.

=== PAGE 246 ===
Feedback
Feedback is one of the key concepts of the systems approach. The health
educator can modify the elements of the system (e.g. message, channel) in the
light of feedback from his audience. For effective communication, the
feedback is of paramount importance.

=== PAGE 247 ===
COMMUNICATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION
Communication plays an important part in the process of learning and
education. It forms the basis for exchange of ideas or information and plays a
significant role in human daily life. The health educator should know how to
communicate effectively with the people to whom he imparts health
education.
Communication can be regarded as a twoway process of exchanging or
shaping ideas, feelings and information. The art and science of
communication forms the principal foundation of health education and
disease prevention.

=== PAGE 248 ===

Key Elements in Communication
5
The entire process of communication is generally made up of four key
elements which are the following:
Communicator
: He is the originator of the message. An effective
communicator must know the objectives, understand the needs of the
audience, identify the interests of the people and know the proper
medium for communication to be used.
Audience
: They are the consumers of the message and may be the total
population or specific groups. The audience should have the patience to
listen to the communicator and should also clarify their doubts or
matters which they have not understood.
Message
: It is the information a communicator wishes his audience to
receive, understand, accept, and act upon. The message should be
based or related to the interests of the people, clear and easily
understandable, be specific and should be in conjunction with the
objectives of the programme.
Channels of communication
: It is the medium of communication and
an attempt should be made to provide variety in selecting the channels
so as to keep the teaching process interesting and entertaining.

Types of Communication
One-way communication (didactic method)
:
 This involves flow of
communication in one direction from the communicator to the
audience. The most common example would be the lecture method in
classrooms. The drawbacks of this method include:
Knowledge is imposed
Learning is authoritative
Does not influence human behaviour
No feedback
Tzvo-zvay communication (socratic method):
 This method of
communication involves both the communicator and the audience. The
audience may raise questions, ideas and opinions to the subject. Here
the process of learning is more active and democratic and is most likely
to influence human behaviour than didactic method.
Verbal communication
:
 This is the traditional way of communication
by word of mouth. Direct verbal communication may be loaded with
hidden meanings and is persuasive.
Non-verbal communication:
 This type of communication mainly
involves a whole range of bodily movements and facial expressions.
Silence is non-verbal communication. It can speak louder than words.
Formal and informal communications:
 Formal communication
follows lines of authority whereas informal communication is
conversing with friends or colleagues. Informal communication may be
more effective, if formal channels do not cater to the information
needs.
Visual communication:
 The visual form of communication comprise:
charts and graphs, pictograms, tables, maps, poster, etc.

=== PAGE 250 ===

Barriers of Communication
Researchers have identified many barriers in communication that can be
classified as follows:
Physiological
: Difficulties in hearing, expression.
Psychological
: Emotional disturbances and neurosis.
Environmental
: Noise, invisibility, congestion.
Cultural
: Levels of knowledge and understanding, customs, beliefs,
attitudes.
The barriers should be identified and removed for achieving effective
communication. Inability to do so will leave an impact upon the health
message given to them.

EDUCATIONAL AIDS IN HEALTH EDUCATION
Health educators make use of various aids in the process of health education.
They can be classified mainly into audio, video and a combination of both.
5
Audio aids:
 These are based on the principle of sound and electricity.
These include the following:
Tape recorder
Microphones
Amplifiers
Radio
Gramophones
Visual aids:
Not requiring projection:
 Models, blackboard, charts, leaflets,
posters and exhibits.
Requiring projection:
 Slides, film strip, bioscope and
projectors.
Combined AV aids:
TV
Sound films (cinema)
Slide-tape combination
Multimedia computers
A thorough knowledge of the advantages, disadvantages and limitations
of each audiovisual aid is necessary in order to make proper use of them. AV
aids are the means to an end, not an end in themselves.

=== PAGE 252 ===
METHODS IN HEALTH COMMUNICATION
The methods in health education may be grouped into three main types.
These include individual, group and mass approach. Anyone or a
combination of these methods can be used selectively at different times,
depending upon the objectives to be achieved, the behaviour to be influenced
and available funds.

Individual Approach
It may be given in personal interviews in the consultation room of the doctor
or in health centre or in homes of the people. The people involved are the
public health nurses, health visitors and health inspectors, Anganwadi
workers.
Individual approach
Group approach
Mass approach
Personal contact
Lectures
Television
Home visit
Demonstrations
Radio
Personal letters
Discussion methods
News papers
 
Group discussion
Printed materials
 
Panel discussion
Direct mailing
 
Symposium
Posters
 
Workshop and
conferences
Health museum
and exhibition
 
Seminars
Folk methods
 
Role play
Internet
The biggest 
advantage
 of individual health teaching is that we can
discuss, argue and persuade the individual to change his behaviour. It
provides opportunities to ask questions in terms of specific interests.
The 
limitation
 of individual health teaching is that the numbers we reach
are small, and health education is given only to those who come in contact
with us.

Group Approach
Our society contains groups of many kinds.
School children, mothers, industrial workers, patients, etc. Group
teaching is an effective way of educating the community.
The choice of subject in group health teaching is very important. It
must relate directly to the interest of the group. A brief account of the
various methods of group education is described below.
Chalk and talk (lecture)
:
 May be defined as—carefully prepared oral
presentation of facts, organized thoughts and ideas by the qualified
person. Lecture effectiveness depends on speaker’s ability to write
legibly and draw on black board. The group to whom the lecture is
given should not be more than 30 and talk should not exceed 15–20
minutes.
The lecture method can be more effective by combining with suitable
audiovisual aids as:
Flip charts
: Series of charts (or posters) 25 × 30 cm or more
flashed or displayed. These flip charts should be brief and to the
point, hold attention, help lecture to proceed.
Flannel graph
: Rough flannel or khadi fixed over a wooden
board is used as a background, over this the cutout pictures,
graphs, drawing, etc. are displayed. The pictures are made rough
on back side by pasting a piece of sand paper which will make it
adhere at once when put on flannel.
Exhibits
: Objects, models, specimens and films and charts.
Disadvantages of lectures
Students are involved to a minimum extent
Learning is passive
Do not stimulate thinking or problem solving capacity
The health behaviour of listeners are not necessarily affected.
Demonstration
:
 A demonstration is a carefully prepared presentation
to show how to perform a skill or procedure. The demonstration is
performed step by step in front of the audience making them

understand and involve in discussion. This upholds the principle of
‘seeing is believing’ and ‘learning by doing’. This approach has a high
motivational value.
Group discussion
:
 It is a very effective method that permits to learn by
freely exchanging their ideas, knowledge and opinions. For effective
group discussions, the group should not be less than 6 and not more
than 12 members. Here the participants are all seated in a circle.
There should be a leader—initiates, avoids side conversations,
encourages everyone to participate and sums up the discussion in the
end. In group discussion, members should follow certain rules as:
Express ideas clearly and concisely
Listen to what others say
Do not interrupt when others are speaking
Accept criticism gracefully
Help to reach conclusions
Limitations
:
 Unequal participation of members and some may deviate
from the subject
Panel discussion
:
 Here about 4–8 persons who are qualified to talk
about a topic will discuss the given problem in front of a large group or
audience. The panel discussion comprises of a chairman or moderator
and 4–8 speakers.
There is no specific agenda, no order of speaking and no set speeches.
After speaker’s discussion, the audience is invited to take part. The
discussion should be spontaneous and natural. This approach can be
extremely useful method of education, provided it is properly planned
and guided.
Symposium
:
 It is a series of speeches on selected subjects. Each person
or expert presents an aspect of the subject briefly. There is no
discussion among speakers. Audience may raise questions. At the end,
chairman makes a comprehensive summary.
Workshop
:
 Consists of a series of meeting (4 or more) with emphasis
on individual work, within the group, with the help of consultants and
resource personnel. It provides opportunities to improve his
effectiveness as a professional worker.

=== PAGE 256 ===

9.
Role-playing (socio drama)
:
 This approach is based on assumption
that many values in situation cannot be expressed in words and the
communication can be more effective, if dramatized by the group. The
size of the group will be best at 25. This is followed by discussion of
the problem.
Conferences and seminars
:
 Usually held on a regional, state or
national level and ranges from half a day to a week length. May cover
single topic in depth or be broadly comprehensive. Here they use a
variety of aids from self instruction to multimedia.
Colloquy
:
 Audience gets the opportunity for direct participation. A
group of experts on particular topic of discussion are selected and they
listen to the problems or questions raised by the members of the
audience. The experts give answers and comments on the particular
problem.

Mass Approach—Education of the General Public
These are one-way communication approach and are useful in transmitting
messages to the people even in remotest places. The numbers reached by this
approach are usually millions. This is the approach that can give high returns
for the time and money involved. These include:
Television
Radio
Health magazine
News papers
Printed materials
Direct mailing
Posters, bill boards and signs
Health museums and exhibitions
Films
The mass media are only instruments. As such they are neither good nor
bad; what matters is the message they carry and the way the message is
delivered. However, this approach used when alone is inefficient in changing
human behaviour, and has to be used in conjugation with other methods for it
to be effective.

=== PAGE 258 ===

THE SITE OF ORAL HEALTH EDUCATION
In the office or clinic
:
 The process of education for oral health applies
in the one-to-one setting with a patient. First, of course, is the
advantage of working with one person at a time. Second, the dental
professional often sees these same persons periodically over longer
periods of time, perhaps for many years permitting the development of
high levels of trust and allowing reinforcement and gradually
refinement of desirable skills, knowledge and attitudes.
6
 It is not
necessary to teach everything at once, a reasonable long-range
educational plan can be developed and implemented for each patient.
In the school
:
 An atmosphere in which the pursuit of knowledge
prevails would seem the ideal location to bring about extensive
changes in oral health behaviours, attitudes and knowledge. Recent
teaching has focused on developing the knowledge and skills needed to
brush and floss the teeth. Attention also has been directed to
establishing desired habits by including supervised plaque removal in
the class. Should a classroom session be planned, several factors must
be remembered.
First, the visit should be cleared with all persons who have
responsibility for monitoring instructions by non-school personnel.
Prior to the visit the process of planning, including a careful
identification of needs for instruction should be conducted and
appropriate objectives established-preferably jointly with the teacher
and the students. Finally after instruction has been given, it should be
evaluated against the objective.
6
In the community
:
 Education for oral health in the community often
seems limited to activities such as puppet shows, smile contests or
public service announcements on television, radio, or newspaper.
The dental health professional should pursue the planning process
particularly when the objective is to improve oral health status.
6
 The
content should emphasis the known effective preventive measures, e.g.
fluorides and sealants, and educational methods should encompass
activities such as community organization and community
development.

PLANNING A DENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION
PROGRAMME
Collect background information
:
 The first stage is to collect relevant
information on the problem. It is necessary to establish the correct
scientific facts which are to be communicated.
Define the target population
:
 The target population will ensure
efficient utilisation of resources by preventing the inclusion of
irrelevant groups.
Assessment of baseline knowledge
:
 Too often health educators tell
people what they already know and fail to give information that the
target group wants.
Anchorage attitude
:
 These are basic to a person’s way of life and are a
form of personal identity. People strongly resist the attempt to change
them. Health educators should try to utilize these believes and opinions
in a positive way.
Level of literacy
:
 Before using visual or written presentation, it is
essential to assess population levels of literacy so that the appropriate
educational techniques are utilized.
Define objective
:
 It is necessary to have precise objectives stated in
terms of the knowledge or behaviour that are expected from the target
group.
Assess resources
:
 It is important to ensure that the necessary facilities
and personnel are available to carry out the programme. It is necessary
to consider the possible effects of programme on other professional
groups.
Pilot study
:
 Ideas are put into practice on a small scale so that
problems can be discovered and necessary modifications made before
the main programme is initiated.
Timing of a programme
: It is important to give careful consideration
to the timing of a health education. This will reduce the possibility of
the target population not being available and receptive.
Evaluation
:
 This should occur during the conduct of the programme

=== PAGE 260 ===
a.
b.
and at the end.
Mid-term evaluation
: It is important to monitor the programme
as it is being conducted to ensure that it is proceeding as
designed and planned.
End-term evaluation
: The evaluation of the health education
programme can be done at the end of the programme, provided
the objectives of the programme are clearly defined. It is
possible to measure the change in knowledge and attitudes by
well-designed questionnaire.

=== PAGE 261 ===
CONCLUSION
Health education is the systematic application of a set of techniques to
voluntarily and positively influence health through changing the antecedents
of behaviors in individuals, groups, or communities. It is a complex activity
which includes a variety of individuals who play a vital role. Effective health
education is largely dependent upon detailed planning and team work.
It is important that all health education advice and support is based upon
scientifically sound evidence. Health education the context exceeds beyond
the conventional sectors and should be the concern of everybody engaged in
any form of community related works.

CHAPTER

Health Care
Delivery Systems
India is a country of 28 states and 7 union territories. Under the Constitution
of India, the states are largely independent in matters relating to the delivery
of health care to the people. Each state, therefore, has developed its own
system of health care delivery, independent of the Central Government. The
Central responsibility consists mainly of policy making, planning, guiding,
assisting, evaluating, and coordinating the work of the state health ministries,
so that health services cover every part of the country, and no state lags
behind for want of these services.

HEALTH SYSTEM IN INDIA
The health system in India has 3 main links, i.e. central, state and local or
peripheral.

I – At the Centre
The official “organs” of the health system at the national level consist of: (1)
The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, (2) The Directorate
General of Health Services and, (3) The Central Council of Health and
Family Welfare.
1. Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
1. Organization
A Cabinet Minister, a Minister of State and a Deputy Health Minister head
the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. These are political

created in 1966 within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The
Secretary to the Govt. of India in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
is in overall charge of the Department of Family Welfare. He is assisted by an
Additional Secretary and Commissioner (Family Welfare), and one Joint
Secretary.

Health Minister is the Chairman and the State Health Ministers are the
members.
1
Function
:
 The functions of the Central Council of Health are:
To consider and recommend broad outlines of policy in regard to
matters concerning health in all its aspects such as the provision of
remedial and preventive care, environmental hygiene, nutrition, health
education and the promotion of facilities for training and research.

=== PAGE 268 ===
II – At the State Level
The state is the ultimate authority responsible for all the health services
operating within its jurisdiction. In all the states, the management sector
comprises the State Ministry of Health and a Directorate of Health.
1. State Ministry of Health
A Minister of Health and Family Welfare and a Deputy Minister of Health
and Family Welfare head the State Ministry of Health. The Health Secretariat
is the official organ of the State Ministry of Health and is headed by a
Secretary who is assisted by Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries and a
large administrative staff.
1
2. Directorate of Health
The Director of Health Services is the chief technical adviser to the State
Government on all matters relating to medicine and public health. He is also
responsible for the organization and direction of all health activities. With the
advent of family planning as an important programme, the designation of
Director of Health Services has been changed in some states and is now
known as Director of Health and Family Welfare. A recent development in
some states is the appointment of a Director of Medical Education in view of
the increasing number of medical colleges.
The Director of Health and Family Welfare is assisted by a number of
deputies and assistants. The Deputy and Assistant Directors of Health may be
of two types—regional and functional. The Regional Directors inspect all the
branches of public health within their jurisdiction, irrespective of their
speciality. The Functional Directors are usually specialists in a particular
branch of public health such as mother and child health, family planning,
nutrition, tuberculosis, leprosy, health education, etc.

III – At the District Level
The District
The principal unit of administration in India is the district under a Collector.
Within each district again, there are 6 types of administrative areas:
Sub-divisions
Tehsils (Taluks)
Community development blocks
Muncipalities and corporations
Villages
Panchayats
Most districts in India are divided into two or more subdivisions, each in
charge of an Assistant Collector or sub-Collector. Each division is again
divided into tehsils (taluks), in charge of a Tehsildar. A tehsil usually
comprises between 200 and 600 villages. Since the launching of the
Community Development Programme in India in 1952, the rural areas of the
district have been organized into blocks, known as community development
blocks, the area of which may or may not coincide with a tehsil. The block is
a unit of rural planning and development, and comprises approximately 100
villages and about 80,000 to 1,20,000 population, in charge of a Block
Development Officer. Finally there are the village panchayats, which are
institutions of rural local self-government.
The urban areas of the district are organized into the following
institutions of local selfgovernment:
Town area committees (in areas with population ranging between
5,000 and 10,000)
Municipal boards (in areas with population ranging between 10,000
and 2 lakhs)
Corporations (with population above 2 lakhs)
The town area committees are like panchayats. They provide sanitary
services. A Chairman/President elected usually by the members heads the
Municipal Boards. The term of a Municipal Board ranges between 3 and 5

=== PAGE 270 ===
1.
2.
3.
1.
2.
years. The functions of a municipal board are: Construction and maintenance
of roads, sanitation and drainage, street lighting, water supply, maintenance
of hospitals and dispensaries, education, registration of births and deaths, etc.
Mayors head corporations. The councilors are elected from different wards of
the city. The executive agency includes the Commissioner, the Secretary, the
Engineer and the Health Officer. The activities are similar to those of the
municipalities, but on a much wider scale.
1
Panchayati Raj
The Panchayati Raj is a 3-tier structure of rural local self-government in
India, linking the village to the district. The three institutions are:
Panchayat—at the village level
Panchayat Samiti—at the block level
Zila Parishad—at the district level
Village level
:
Gram Sabha
: It is the assembly of all the adults of the village, which
meets at least twice a year. The Gram Sabha considers proposals for
taxation, discusses the annual programme and elects members of the
Gram Panchayat.
Gram Panchayat
: It is the executive organ of the Gram Sabha, and an
agency for planning and development at the village level. Its strength
varies from 15 to 30, and the population covered also varies widely
from 5,000 to 15,000 or more. The members of the panchayat hold
office for a period of 3 to 4 years. Every panchayat has an elected
President (Sarpanch or Sabhapati or Mukhiya), a Vice-President and a
Panchayat Secretary. The powers and functions of the Panchayat
Secretary are very wide—they cover the entire field of civic
administration, including sanitation and public health; and a social and
economic development of the village. 
2
Block level
:
 The block consists of about 100 villages and a population
of about 80,000 to 1, 20,000. The Panchayati Raj agency at the block
level is the Panchayat Samiti/Janpada Panchayat. The Panchayat Samiti
consists of all Sarpanchas (heads) of the village panchayats in the
Block; MLAs, MPs residing in the block area; representatives of

=== PAGE 271 ===
3.
women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and cooperative societies.
The Block Development Officer (BDO) is the ex-officio secretary of
the Panchayat Samiti. The prime function of the Panchayat Samiti is
the execution of the community development programme in the block.
The funds provided by the government for development are channeled
through the Panchayat Samiti. The Block Development Officer and his
staff give technical assistance and guidance to the village panchayat
engaged in development work.
District level
:
 The Zilla Parishad/Zilla Panchayat is the agency of rural
local selfgovernment at the district level. The Zilla Parishad is
primarily supervisory and coordinating body. The members of the Zila
Parishad include all heads of the Panchayat Samiti in the district; MPs,
MLs of the district; representatives of scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes and women, and 2 persons of experience in administration,
public life or rural development. The Collector of the district is a non-
voting member. Thus, the membership of the Zilla Parishad is fairly
large varying from 40 to 70.
Rural Development
Community development programme
Community development was defined as “a process designed to create
conditions of economic and social progress for the whole community with its
active participation and the fullest possible reliance upon the community’s
initiative.”
4
A programme, known as the Community Development Programme, was
launched on 2
nd
 October 1952 for all-round development of the rural areas.
The Community Development Programme was envisaged as a
multipurpose programme covering the following main activities—
improvement of agriculture, improvement of communications, education,
health and sanitation (through the establishment of primary health centres and
subcentres), improvement of housing through self-help, social welfare and
training in rural arts, crafts and industries to local people.
Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)
:
 It was launched in
April 1978 to eliminate rural poverty and improve the quality of life of the
rural poor. The target families are generally agricultural labourers, small

=== PAGE 272 ===
cultivators, village artisans and craftsmen. They are provided with resources
and skills, bank loans and subsidies by the government. The IRDP is being
implemented through District Rural Development Agency (DRDA).
The Village Level Worker
The village level worker (Gram Sevak) is the key person responsible for
transforming the economic and social life of the people. Each Gram Sevak is
in charge of 10 villages and attends to 5 or 6 thousand people. He lives with
the people and keeps in close touch with them and their families. He probes
into their “felt-needs” and seeks to arouse in them interest in all-round family
and village development. In short, he functions as a multipurpose worker and
a link between the people and governmental agencies.

=== PAGE 273 ===
NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY
The main objective of this policy is to achieve an acceptable standard of good
health amongst the general population of the country. The approach would be
to increase access to the decentralized public health system by establishing
new infrastructure in deficient areas, and by upgrading the Infrastructure in
the existing institutions. Overriding importance would be given to ensuring a
more equitable access to health services across the social and geographical
expanse of the country. Emphasis will be given to increasing the aggregate
public health investment through a substantially increased contribution by the
Central Government. It is expected that this initiative will strengthen the
capacity of the public health administration at the State level to render
effective service delivery. The contribution of the private sector in providing
health services would be much enhanced, particularly for the population
group which can afford to pay for services.
Primacy will be given to preventive and first-line curative initiatives at
the primary health level through increased sectoral share of allocation.
Emphasis will be laid on rational use of drugs within the allopathic system.
Increased access to tried and tested systems of traditional medicine will be
ensured. Within these broad objectives, NHP-2002 will endeavour to achieve
the time-bound goals mentioned in

1. PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR
a. Primary Health Care
Definition
:
 “Primary health care is essential health care made universally
accessible to individuals and acceptable to them, through their full
participation and at a cost the community and country can afford. “
3a
Elements of Primary Health Care
The Alma-Ata declaration has outlined 8 essential components of primary
health care:
Education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of
preventing and controlling them.
Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition.
An adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation.
Maternal and child health care, including family planning.
Immunization against major infectious diseases.
Prevention and control of locally endemic diseases.
Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries.
Provision of essential drugs.
Principles of Primary Health Care
Equitable distribution
:
 The first key principle in the primary health
care strategy is equity or equitable distribution of health services, i.e.
health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of
their ability to pay, and all (rich or poor, urban or rural) must have
access to health services.
Community participation
:
 The involvement of individuals, families,
and communities in promotion of their own health and welfare, is an
essential ingredient of primary health care. There must be a continuing
effort to secure meaningful involvement of the community in the
planning, implementation and maintenance of health services.

=== PAGE 278 ===

c.
d.
1.
Intersectoral coordination
:
 An important element of intersectoral
approach is planning—planning with other sectors to avoid
unnecessary duplication of activities. To achieve such cooperation,
countries may have to review their administrative system, relocate their
resources and introduce suitable legislation to ensure that coordination
can take place.
Appropriate technology
:
 Appropriate technology has been defined as
“technology that is scientifically sound, adaptable to local needs, and
acceptable to those who apply it and those for whom it is used, and that
can be maintained by the people themselves in keeping with the
principles of selfreliance with the resources the community and country
can afford.”
In 1977, the Govt. of India launched a Rural Health Scheme, based on the
principle of “placing people’s health in people’s hand.” Keeping in view the
WHO goal of “Health for All” by 2000 AD, the Govt. of India evolved a
National Health Policy based on primary health care approach. It was
approved by Parliament in 1983. Steps are already under way to implement
the National Health Policy objectives towards achieving Health for all by the
year 2000 AD.
3b
 These are described below:
Village Level
To implement the National Health Policy at the village level, the following
schemes are in operation:
Village health guide scheme
Training of local dais
ICDS scheme
ASHA scheme
Village health guide
:
 A village health guide is a person with an aptitude for
social service and is not a full time govt. functionary. It was introduced on
2
nd
 October 1977 with the idea of securing people’s participation in the care
of their own health. The guidelines for their selection are:
They should be permanent residents of the local community, preferably
women.

=== PAGE 279 ===
2.
3.
4.
They should be able to read and write, having minimum formal
education at least up to the VI standard.
They should be acceptable to all sections of the community.
They should be able to spare at least 2 to 3 hours everyday for
community health work.
They undergo a short training in primary health care at the nearest
primary health centre for a duration of 200 hours, spread over a period of 3
months. On completion of training, they receive a working manual and a kit
of simple medicines belonging to the modern and traditional systems of
medicine in vogue in that part of the country to which they belong. The duties
assigned include treatment of simple ailments and activities in first aid,
mother and child health including family planning, health education and
sanitation. As of date, there are 4.10 lakhs village health guides functioning
in the country. The target is to achieve 1 health guide for each village or 1000
rural population.
1
Local dais
:
 An extensive programme has been undertaken, under the Rural
Health Scheme, to train all categories of local 
dais
 (traditional birth
attendants) in the country to improve their knowledge in the elementary
concepts of maternal and child health and sterilization, besides obstetric
skills. The training is for 30 working days, at the primary health centre for 2
days in a week, and on the remaining 4 days of the week they accompany the
health worker (female) to the villages preferably in the dai’s own area. After
successful completion of training, each dai is provided with a delivery kit and
a certificate. The national target is to train one local dai in each village.
1
Anganwadi workers
:
 Angan means a courtyard. Under the ICDS (Integrated
Child Development Services) scheme, there is a Anganwadi worker for a
population of 1000. There are about 100 such workers in each ICDS project.
The Anganwadi worker is selected from the community she is expected to
serve. She undergoes training in various aspects of health, nutrition, and child
development for 4 months. The services provided by her include health
checkup, immunization, supplementary nutrition, health education, non-
formal pre-school education and referral services. The beneficiaries are
especially nursing mothers, other women and children below the age of 6
years.

=== PAGE 280 ===
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)
ASHA must be the resident of the village—a woman
(married/widow/divorced) preferably in the age group of 25 to 45 years with
formal education up to eighth class, having communication skills and
leadership qualities. Adequate representation from the disadvantaged
population group should be ensured to serve such groups better.
The general norm of selection will be one ASHA for 1000 population. In
tribal, hilly and desert areas, the norm could be relaxed to one ASHA per
habitation.
Role and responsibility of ASHA
ASHA will be a health activist in the community who will create awareness
on health. Her responsibilities will be as follows:
ASHA will take steps to create awareness and provide information to
the community on determinates of health such as nutrition, basic
sanitation and hygienic practices, healthy living and working
conditions, information on existing health services, and the need for
timely utilization of health and family welfare services.
She will counsel women on birth preparedness, importance of safe
delivery, breastfeeding and complementary feeding, immunization,
contraception and prevention of common infections including
reproductive tract infection/sexually transmitted infection and care of
the young child.
ASHA will mobilize the community and facilitate them in accessing
health and health-related services available at the
Anganwadi/subcentre/primary health centres, such as immunization,
antenatal check-up, postnatal check-up, supplementary nutrition,
sanitation and other services being provided by the government.
She will work with the village health and sanitation committee of the
Gram Panchayat to develop a comprehensive village health plan.
She will arrange escort/accompany pregnant women and children
requiring treatment/admission to the nearest pre-identified health
facility, i.e. primary health centre/community health centre/first referral
unit.

=== PAGE 281 ===
6.
7.
8.
ASHA will provide primary medical care for minor ailments such as
diarrhoea, fevers, and first-aid for minor injuries. She will be a
provider of directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) under
revised national tuberculosis control programme.
She will also act as a depot holder for essential provisions being made
available to every habitation like oral rehydration therapy, iron folic
acid tablet, chloroquine, disposable delivery kits, oral pills and
condoms, etc. She will inform about the births and deaths in her village
and any unusual health problems/disease outbreaks in the community
to the subcentre/primary health care.
She will promote construction of household toilets under total
sanitation campaign.
Subcentre Level
The subcentre is the peripheral outpost of the existing health delivery system
in rural areas. They are being established on the basis of one subcentre for
every 3000 population in hilly, tribal and backward areas and for every 5000
population in general. One male and one female multipurpose health worker
attends each subcentre. The functions of a subcentre are limited to mother
and child health care, family planning and immunization.
Primary Health Centre Level
The Bhore Committee on 1946 gave birth to the concept of the primary
health centre as the basic health unit, to provide, as close to the people as
possible, an integrated curative and a preventive health care to the rural
population with emphasis on preventive and promotive aspects of health care.
The Bhore Committee aimed at having a health centre to serve a population
of 10,000 to 20,000 with 6 medical officers, 6 public health nurses and other
supporting staff.
2
The Central Council of Health in January 1953 had recommended the
establishment of the health centres. But these centres were not able to provide
adequate health coverage, partly because they were poorly staffed and
equipped.
The Mudaliar Committee in 1962 had recommended that the existing
primary health centre should be strengthened and the population to be served

=== PAGE 282 ===

10.
by them to be scaled down to 40,000.
The National Health Plan 1983 proposed reorganisation of primary health
centres on the basis of one primary health centre for every 30,000 rural
population in the plains, and one primary health centre for every 20,000
population in hilly, tribal and backward areas for more effective coverage. As
on 30
th
 June 1996, 21, 854 primary health centres have been established in
the country against the total requirement of 23,000.
Functions of the primary health centre
Medical care.
Maternal and child health including family planning.
Safe water supply and basic sanitation.
Prevention and control of locally endemic disease.
Collecting and reporting of vital statistics.
Education about health.
National health programmes.
Referral services.
Training of health workers, health guides, local dais and health
assistants.
Basic laboratory health services.
It is proposed to equip the primary health centres with facilities for
selected surgical procedures and for paediatric care.

=== PAGE 283 ===
b. Hospitals/Health Centres
Community Health Centre
The community health centres were established by upgrading the primary
health centres, each community health centre covering a population of 80,000
to 1.2 lakhs with 30 beds and specialists in surgery, medicine, obstetrics and
gynaecology, and paediatrics with X-ray and laboratory facilities. A new
non-medical post called community health officer was created at each health
centre. The specialist at the community health centre may refer a patient
directly to a state level hospital or the nearest medical college hospital.
1
Staffing pattern

=== PAGE 284 ===
Apart from the primary health centres, the present organisation of health
services of the government sector consists of rural hospitals,
subdivisional/tehsils/taluka hospitals, district hospitals, speciality hospitals
and teaching institutions.
Rural Hospitals
It is now proposed to upgrade the rural dispensaries to primary health centres.
At present, a number of primary health centres also have hospitals. There are
plans to have an epidemiological wing attached to them.

=== PAGE 285 ===
1.
2.
3.
District Hospitals
There are proposals to convert the district hospitals to district health centres.
A hospital differs from a health centre in the following respects:
In a hospital, services are provided are mostly curative, while in a
health centre services are preventive, promotive and curative.
A hospital has no catchment area while a health centre is responsible
for a definite area and population.
In the hospital, the team consists of only the curative staff while the
health team in a health centre is a mix of medical and paramedical
workers.

c. Health Insurance Schemes
There is no universal health insurance in India. Health insurance is at present
limited to industrial workers and their families.
Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESI Scheme)
The ESI scheme, introduced by an Act of parliament in 1948, is a unique
piece of social legislation in India. It has introduced for the first time in India,
the principle of contribution by the employer and employee. The Act
provides for medical care in cash and kind, benefits in the contingency of
sickness, maternity, employment injury, and pension. for dependents as on
the death of worker because of employment injury.
Central Government Health Scheme
This scheme was introduced in 1954 in New Delhi for the central government
employees to provide comprehensive medical care to the central government
employees. It is based on the principle of co-operative effort by the employee
and the employer, to the mutual advantage of both.
The facilities under the scheme include:
Out-patient care through a network of dispensaries.
Supply of necessary drugs.
Laboratory and X-ray investigation.
Domiciliary visits.
Hospitalization facilities at government as well as private hospitals
recognised for the purpose.
Specialist consultations.
Paediatric services including immunization.
Antenatal, natal, and postnatal services.
Emergency treatment.
Supply of optical and dental aids at reasonable rates.
Family welfare services.
These two schemes cover two large groups of wage earners in the

=== PAGE 287 ===
country. They are well organized health insurance schemes, and are
providing reasonable medical care plus some essential preventive and
promotive health services.

=== PAGE 288 ===
d. Other Health Agencies
Defence Medical Services
Defence services have their own organization for medical care to defence
personal under the banner “Armed Forces Medical Services.” The services
provided are integrated and comprehensive embracing preventive, promotive,
and curative services.
Health Care of Railway Employees
The railways provide comprehensive health care services through the agency
of railway hospitals, health units and clinics. Health check-up of employees is
provided at the time of entry into service, and thereafter at yearly intervals.
There are lady medical officers, health visitors and midwives who look after
the maternal and child health and school health services. Specialist services
are also available at the divisional hospitals.

=== PAGE 289 ===
2. PRIVATE SECTOR
In a mixed economy such as India’s, private practice provides a large share of
the health services available. The general practitioners constitute 70% of the
medical profession and most of them tend to congregate in urban areas,
providing mainly curative services to those who can pay. The Medical
Council of India and the Indian Medical Association regulates some of the
functions and activities of the large body of private registered practitioners.

=== PAGE 290 ===
3. INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF MEDICINE
The practitioners of indigenous systems of medicine (ayurveda, siddha,
homeopathy, etc.) provide the bulk of medical care to the rural people.
Studies indicate that nearly 90% of ayurvedic physicians serve the rural areas.
In recent years, there has been considerable state patronage to foster these
systems of medicine. Many ayurvedic dispensaries are state run. The
Government of India is studying the question of how indigenous systems of
medicine could best be utilised form or effective or total health coverage.

=== PAGE 291 ===
4. VOLUNTARY HEALTH AGENCIES
The voluntary health agencies occupy an important place in community
health programmes. “A voluntary health agency may be defined as an
organization that is administered by an autonomous board which holds
meetings, collects funds for its support chiefly from private sources and
expends money, whether with or without paid workers, in conducting a
programme directed primarily to furthering the public health by providing
health services or health education, or by advancing research or legislation
for health, or by a combination of these activities”.

Epidemiological
Methods
Epidemiology is the basic science of preventive and social medicine.
Epidemiology has evolved rapidly during the past three decades. Its
ramifications cover not only the study of disease distribution and causation,
but also health and health-related events occurring in human populations. By
identifying risk factors of chronic disease, evaluating treatment modalities
and health services, it has provided new opportunities for prevention,
treatment, planning and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of health
services. Epidemiology is derived from the word epidemic (epi = among;
demos = people; logos = study).
1
The Greek physician 
Hippocrates
 has been called the ‘Father of
Epidemiology’. He is the first person known to have examined the
relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental
influences.

Definition
The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states and
events in populations, and the application of this study to control health
problems (John Last-1988).
The three components of this definition
 are:
5
Disease frequency
:
 Basic measures of disease frequency are ratio or
rate. It helps to compare disease frequency in different populations or
subgroups in relation to suspected causal factors.
Distribution of disease
:
 The basic tenet of epidemiology is that the
distribution of disease occurs in patterns which gives a clue to the
causative factors. These distribution patterns are studied in terms of
time, place and person.
Determinants of disease
:
 An unique feature of epidemiology is to test
aetiological hypothesis and identify the underlying causes of disease.
This aspect of epidemiology is known as “analytical epidemiology.”

AIMS
To describe the distribution and size of disease problems in human
populations.
To identify aetiological factors.
To provide the data essential to the planning, implementation,
evaluation of services for the prevention, control, treatment, and to the
setting up priorities among those services.

Epidemiological Approach
Asking questions
:
Related to health events
—what is the event, what is its
magnitude, where did it occur, when did it occur, who are
affected, why did it happen?
Related to health action
—what can be done to reduce this
problem, to prevent it, what action has to be taken by the
community, health services, other sectors, where and for whom,
what resources are required, how are the activities to be
organized, what difficulties will arise and how to overcome
them?
Making comparison
:
 The basic approach in epidemiology is to make
comparisons and draw inferences. This may be comparison of exposed
and not exposed, or those having and not having the disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRIAD
The epidemiologic triangle (
Fig. 7.1
) is a model that scientists have
developed for studying health problems. It can help us understand infectious
diseases and how they spread. The triangle has three corners (called 
vertices
):
Fig. 7.1:
 The epidemiologic triangle
Agent
, or microbe that causes the disease (the “what” of the triangle)
Host
, or organism harboring the disease (the “who” of the triangle)
Environment
, or those external factors that cause or allow disease
transmission (the “where” of the triangle)
An 
outbreak
 or an 
epidemic
 exists when there are more cases of a
particular disease than expected in a given area, or among a specific group of
people, over a particular period of time. Another term you might come across
is 
endemic
, when a population has a high level of the disease all the time. For
example, giardiasis and even malaria are endemic in parts of the world.
The mission of an epidemiologist is to break at least one of the sides of
the triangle, disrupting the connection between the environment, the host, and
the agent, and stopping the continuation of disease.

=== PAGE 308 ===
Parts of the Epidemiologic Triangle
Vertex 1
. The agent—“what”
. The agent is the cause of the disease. When
studying the epidemiology of most infectious diseases, the agent is a microbe
—an organism too small to be seen with the naked eye. Disease-causing
microbes are bacteria, virus, fungi, and protozoa (a type of parasite). They are
what most people call “germs.”
Vertex 2
. The host—“who”
. Hosts are organisms, usually humans or
animals, which are exposed to and harbor a disease. The host can be the
organism that gets sick, as well as any animal carrier (including insects and
worms) that may or may not get sick. Although the host may or may not
know it has the disease or have any outward signs of illness, the disease does
take lodging from the host. The “host” heading also includes symptoms of the
disease. Different people may have different reactions to the same agent. For
example, adults infected with the virus 
varicella
 (chickenpox) are more likely
than children to develop serious complications.
Vertex 3
. The environment—“where”
. The environment is the favourable
surroundings and conditions 
external
 to the host that cause or allow the
disease to be transmitted. Some diseases live best in dirty water. Others
survive in human blood. Still others, like 
E. coli
, thrive in warm temperatures
but are killed by high heat. Other environment factors include the season of
the year (in the US, the peak of the flu season is between November and
March, for example).

=== PAGE 309 ===
Time
In the center of the triangle is time. Most infectious diseases have an
incubation period—the time between when the host is infected and when
disease symptoms occur. Or, time may describe the duration of the illness or
the amount of time a person can be sick before death or recovery occurs.
Time also describes the period from an infection to the threshold of an
epidemic for a population.

=== PAGE 310 ===
Core Epidemiologic Functions
In the mid-1980s, five major tasks of epidemiology in public health practice
were identified: 
Public health surveillance, field investigation, analytic
studies, evaluation, and linkages
. A sixth task, policy development, was
recently added. These tasks are described below.
Public Health Surveillance
Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis,
interpretation, and dissemination of health data to help guide public health
decision making and action. Surveillance is equivalent to monitoring the
pulse of the community. The purpose of public health surveillance, which is
sometimes called “information for action,” is to portray the ongoing patterns
of disease occurrence and disease potential so that investigation, control, and
prevention measures can be applied efficiently and effectively.
Field Investigation
As noted above, surveillance provides information for action. One of the first
actions that results from a surveillance case report or report of a cluster is
investigation by the public health department. The investigation may be as
limited as a phone call to the healthcare provider to confirm or clarify the
circumstances of the reported case, or it may involve a field investigation
requiring the coordinated efforts of dozens of people to characterize the
extent of an epidemic and to identify its cause.
Analytic Studies
Surveillance and field investigations are usually sufficient to identify causes,
modes of transmission, and appropriate control and prevention measures. But
sometimes analytic studies employing more rigorous methods are needed.
Often the methods are used in combination—with surveillance and field
investigations providing clues or hypotheses about causes and modes of
transmission, and analytic studies evaluating the credibility of those
hypotheses.
Evaluation

=== PAGE 311 ===
Epidemiologists, who are accustomed to using systematic and quantitative
approaches, have come to play an important role in evaluation of public
health services and other activities. Evaluation is the process of determining,
as systematically and objectively as possible, the relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, and impact of activities with respect to established goals.
Linkages
Epidemiologists working in public health settings rarely act in isolation. In
fact, field epidemiology is often said to be a “team sport.” During an
investigation, an epidemiologist usually participates as either a member or the
leader of a multidisciplinary team. Other team members may be
laboratorians, sanitarians, infection control personnel, nurses or other clinical
staff, and increasingly, computer information specialists. Many outbreaks
cross geographical and jurisdictional lines, so co-investigators may be from
local, state, or federal levels of government, academic institutions, clinical
facilities, or the private sector. To promote current and future collaboration,
the epidemiologists need to maintain relationships with staff of other
agencies and institutions. Mechanisms for sustaining such linkages include
official memoranda of understanding, sharing of published or on-line
information for public health audiences and outside partners, and informal
networking that takes place at professional meetings.
Policy Development
The definition of epidemiology ends with the following phrase: “... and the
application of this study to the control of health problems.” While some
academically minded epidemiologists have stated that epidemiologists should
stick to research and not get involved in policy development or even make
recommendations, public health epidemiologists do not have this luxury.
Indeed, epidemiologists who understand a problem and the population in
which it occurs are often in a uniquely qualified position to recommend
appropriate interventions. As a result, epidemiologists working in public
health regularly provide input, testimony, and recommendations regarding
disease control strategies, reportable disease regulations, and healthcare
policy.

Tools of Measurements
Rate
:
 Measures the occurrence of some particular events in a
population during a given time period.
Death rate
Ratio
:
 It expresses a relation in size between two random quantities.
Numerator is not a component of the denominator.
Proportion
:
 It is a ratio which indicates the relation in magnitude of a
part of the whole. Numerator is included in the denominator. It is
usually expressed as percentage.

Concept of Numerator and Denominator
Numerator
.
 Refers to then number of times an event has occurred. In
case of rate, the numerator is a component of the denominator.
Denominator
:
 It would be:
Related to the population and would comprise of (i) mid-year
population, (ii) population at risk, (iii) person-time, (iv) person
distance, (v) subgroup of the population.
Related to the total events and comprise of number of accidents
“per 1000 vehicles.”

Measurement of Mortality
Mortality data provide the starting point for many epidemiological studies.
The basis of mortality data is the death certificate.
Limitations of Mortality Data
Incomplete reporting
Lack of accuracy
Lack of uniformity
Choosing a single cause of death
Diseases with low fatality
Use of Mortality Data
Explaining trends
Indicating priorities for health action
Designing intervention programs.
Mortality Rates and Ratios
Crude death rate
Specific death rates: It may be:
Cause or disease specific
Related to specific groups.
Specific death rates due to tuberculosis
Specific death rates for males


=== PAGE 316 ===

Case fatality rate
Proportional mortality rate
: It expresses the “number of deaths due to
a particular cause (or in a specific age group) per 100 (or 1000) total
deaths.”
Survival rate
: For example, 5-year survival rate


=== PAGE 317 ===

Measurement of Morbidity
Morbidity is defined as any departure, subjective or objective from a state of
physiological well-being.
3
Three aspects of morbidity are commonly measured by morbidity rates or
morbidity ratios, namely frequency, duration, and severity. Disease frequency
is measured by incidence and prevalence. Measure of the duration of illness
is measured as average duration/cases. Case fatality rate may be used as an
index of severity (
Fig. 7.2
).
Uses
They describe the extent and nature of disease in the community.
They usually provide more accurate and clinically relevant information
on patient characteristics.
They serve as starting point for aetiological studies and play crucial
role in prevention.
They are needed for monitoring and evaluation of disease control
activities.
Incidence
The number of new cases occurring in a defined population during a
specified period of time.
Incidence rate
For example, 500/30,000 × 1000
= 16.7/1000/year
Uses of incidence rate
:
 For taking action: (a) to control disease, (b) for
research to aetiology and pathogenesis, distribution of diseases, and efficacy
of preventive and therapeutic measures.
Prevalence

=== PAGE 318 ===
1.
2.
Prevalence refers specifically to all current cases (old + new) existing at a
given point in time, or over a period of time in a given population.
Two types: (1) Point prevalence, (2) Period prevalence
1. 
Point prevalence
 is defined as the number of all current cases (old +
new) of a disease at one point in time in relation to a defined population.
The “point” in point prevalence, may for all practical purposes consist of
day, several days, or even a few weeks depending upon the time it takes to
examine the population sample.
2. 
Period prevalence
 measures the frequency of all current cases existing
during a period of time (annual prevalence) expressed in relation to a defined
population.
Uses of prevalence
Helps to estimate the magnitude of health/disease problems in the
community and identify high-risk populations.
Useful for administrative and planning purposes.
Relationship between prevalence (P) and incidence (I)
P = I × D
I = P/D
D = P/I
I = 10 cases/1000 population/year
D = 5 years
P = 10 × 5 = 50/1000 population

=== PAGE 319 ===
Longer the duration of the disease, greater its prevalence, e.g.
tuberculosis.

Measurement of Disability
Disabilities are an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations,
and participation restrictions. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is
a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a
person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.
Overcoming the difficulties faced by people with disabilities requires
interventions to remove environmental and social barriers.
Measures of Disability

Measurements of Natality
Natality measures are population-based measures of birth. These measures
are used primarily by persons working in the field of maternal and child
health.

I. DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY
Descriptive studies are usually the 1
st
 phase of epidemiological investigation.
These studies are concerned with the distribution of diseases or health-related
characteristics in human populations and identifying the characteristics with
which the disease in question seems to be associated. The study describes the
disease in terms of time, place and person. Procedures in descriptive studies
are:
Defining the population to be studied
Defining the disease under study
Describing the disease by—time, place, and person
Measurement of disease
Comparing with known indices
Formulation of an aetiological hypothesis

=== PAGE 324 ===
1. Defining the Population to be Studied
First step is to define the population base not only in terms of the total
number but also in terms of age, sex, occupation, cultural characters and
similar information needed for the study.
6
 “Defined population” can be the
whole population in a geographic area, or specifically selected group such as
age and sex group, occupational groups, school children—wherever a group
of people can be fairly accurately counted and should be stable without
migration. The defined population provides a denominator for calculating
rates.

=== PAGE 325 ===
2. Defining the Disease Under Study
Epidemiologist needs a definition that is both precise and valid to enable him
to identify those who have the disease from those who do not. He looks out
for an “operational definition” that is a definition by which the disease
condition can be identified and measured in the defined population.

3. Describing the Disease
Describing the disease by:
Time
Place
Person
Time Distribution
Patterns of disease may be described by the time of its occurrence that is by
week, month, year, day of the week, etc.
Epidemiologist has identified 3 kinds of time trends in disease
occurrence. They are:
Short-term fluctuations
, e.g. epidemic.
Common source epidemics
.
Single exposure or point source epidemics, e.g. food poisoning.
Continuous or multiple exposure, e.g. water from a
contaminated well.
Propagated epidemics
: It is most often of infectious origin and results
from person to person transmission of an infectious agent. For
example, epidemics of hepatitis A and polio.
Periodic fluctuations
:
Seasonal trend
: It is well known for many communicable diseases, e.g.
measles and varicella.
Cyclic trend
: Some disease occur in cycles spread over short periods of
time which may be days, weeks, months, years. Measles in the pre-
vaccination era appeared in cycles with major peaks every 2 to 3 years
and rubella every 6 to 9 years.
Long-term or secular trends
:
 The term secular trend implies changes
in the occurrence of disease (progressive increase or decrease) over a
long period of time, generally several years or decades.
For example, coronary heart disease, lung cancer and diabetes have
shown a consistent upward trend in the past 50 years or so, followed by

=== PAGE 327 ===
1.
2.
3.
4.

a decline of such diseases as tuberculosis, typhoid, diphtheria and
polio.
5
Interpretation of time trends helps in seeking emerging health problems
and effectiveness of measures to control old ones.
Place Distribution
International variations
National variations
Rural-urban differences
Local distributions
International variation
:
 International comparisons may examine
mortality and morbidity in relation to socioeconomic factors, dietary
differences and the differences in culture and behaviour. For example,
cancer of stomach is very common in Japan and unusual in USA.
Cancers of oral cavity and uterine cervix are exceedingly common in
India as compared to industrialized countries.
National variation
:
 Distributions of endemic goitre, fluorosis, leprosy,
malaria have shown variations in their distribution in India. Such
information is needed to demarcate the affected areas and for providing
appropriate health care services.
Rural-urban differences
:
 Chronic bronchitis, lung cancer,
cardiovascular diseases are usually more common in urban than in
rural areas. Infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate are higher in
rural than urban areas. Variations are due to differences in medical
care, social class levels of sanitation, educational and environmental
factors.
Local distributions
:
 Inner and outer city variations in disease
frequency are well known. These variations are best studied with the
aid of ‘spot maps’ or ‘shaded maps’. These maps show at a glance
areas of high or low frequency the boundaries and patterns of disease
distribution. For example, if the map shows ‘clustering’ of cases, it
may suggest a common source of infection or a common risk factor
shared by all the cases.
Geographic distribution may provide evidence of the source of disease

=== PAGE 328 ===
a.

D.
and its mode of spread. By relating these variations to agent, host and
environmental factors the epidemiologist tries to derive clues to the source of
disease and its mode of spread to formulate and test aetiological hypothesis.
5
Migration studies
:
 They provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of
the possible genetic and environmental factors in the occurrence of disease in
the population.
Comparison of disease and death rates for migrants with those of their
kin who have stayed at home. This permits study of genetically similar
groups but living under different environment. If the disease and death
rates in migrants are similar to the country of adoption, the likely
explanation could be change in the environment.
Comparison of migrants with local population of the host country
provides information on genetically different groups living in similar
environment. If migration rates of disease and death are similar to the
country of origin, the likely explanation could be the genetic factors.
1
Person Distribution
In descriptive studies, the disease is further characterized by defining the
persons who developed the disease by:
Age
:
 It is related to disease than any other single host factor. Certain
diseases are more frequent in certain age groups than in others. For
example, measles in childhood, cancer in middle age and
artheroscelerosis in old age.
Sex
:
 Chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, obesity are
common in females, whereas lung cancer and coronary heart disease
are more common in males. The differences may be due to biological
differences between the sexes and also due to cultural and behavioural
differences.
Ethnicity
:
 Differences in disease occurrence have been noted in
population subgroups of different racial and ethnic origin, e.g.
tuberculosis, cancer, sickle cell anaemia. These differences whether
they are related to genetic or environmental factors, have been a
stimulus to further study.
Marital status
:
 Married persons are generally more secure and

=== PAGE 329 ===

protected and this contributes to lower mortality rates among married
persons.
Occupation
:
 Occupation may alter the habit pattern of employees like
sleep, alcohol, smoking. Persons working in particular occupation are
exposed to particular types of risks. For example, coal miners are likely
to suffer from silicosis, those in sedentary occupation face the risk of
heart disease.
Social class
:
 Individuals in upper social classes have a longer life
expectancy and better health and nutritional status than those in lower
social classes. Certain diseases like cardiovascular diseases,
hypertension and diabetes have shown a higher prevalence in upper
classes compared to lower classes.
Behaviour
:
 Behaviuor is looked upon as a risk factor in modern day
diseases such as cancer, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, etc. For
example, cigarette smoking, sedentary life, over eating and drug abuse.
Stress
:
 Stress has shown to affect a variety of variables related to
patient response, e.g. susceptibility to disease.
Migration
:
 In India, diseases like leprosy, filaria and malaria are
considered to be rural problems. However, because of the movement of
the people from rural to urban areas, these diseases have created a
serious problem in urban areas also.

4. Measurement of Disease
This information should be available in terms of mortality, morbidity,
disability and so on; and should preferably be available for different
subgroups of the population. Measurement of morbidity has 2 aspects—
incidence and prevalence. Incidence can be obtained from “longitudinal”
studies and prevalence from “cross-sectional studies.”
Cross-sectional studies
:
 It is the simplest form of observational study. It is
based on a single examination of a cross-section of population at one point of
time—the results of which can be projected on the whole population provided
the sampling has been done correctly. This study is also known as
“prevalence study”. These studies are more usually for chronic than short-
lived diseases. These studies are useful to:
Know the distribution of a disease rather than aetiology.
Suggest causal hypothesis, which can be tested by analytical study.
Disadvantage
:
Time sequence cannot be deduced.
Little information about the natural history of the disease and rate of
incidence.
Longitudinal studies
:
 In case of longitudinal studies, observations are
repeated in the same population over a prolonged period of time by means of
follow-up examinations. These studies are useful to:
Study natural history of disease and its future outcome.
Identifying risk factors of the disease.
For finding out incidence rate.
Disadvantage
: Difficult to organize and more time consuming.

=== PAGE 331 ===
5. Comparing with Known Indices
By making comparisons between different populations, and subgroups of
same population, it is possible to arrive at clues to disease aetiology and also
identify groups who are at increased risk for certain diseases.

6. Formulation of a Hypothesis
By studying the distribution of disease and utilizing the techniques of
descriptive epidemiology, it is possible to formulate hypothesis relating to
disease aetiology. A hypothesis can be accepted or rejected, using the
techniques of analytical epidemiology.
An epidemiological hypothesis should specify—the population, specific
cause, expected outcome, dose-response relationship, and time-response
relationship.
For example, the smoking of 30–40 cigarettes/day causes lung cancer in
10% of smokers after 20 years of exposure.
Uses of descriptive epidemiology
Provide data regarding the magnitude of disease and type of disease in
the community.
Provide clues to disease aetiology.
Provide data for planning, organizing, evaluating preventive and
curative services.
Contribute to research.

=== PAGE 333 ===
II. ANALYTICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
The objective of analytical epidemiology is to test the aetiological
hypothesis.
3
Analytical epidemiology consists of 2 distinct types of observational
studies: (1) Case control study, (2) Cohort study.
From each of these study designs, one can determine whether or not as
statistical association exists between a disease and a suspected factor and the
strength of the association.

=== PAGE 334 ===
1.

3.
1. Case-Control Study
Often called “retrospective study” is the first approach to test causal
hypothesis. This study has 3 distinct features:
Both exposure and disease occurred before the start of the study.
The study proceeds from effect to cause.
It uses a control group to support or refute an inference.
Frequency of smoking in (1) cases = a/(a + c), (2) controls = b/(b + d).
If the frequency of smoking a/(a + c) is higher in cases than in controls
b/(b + d), an association is said to exist between smoking and lung cancer.

Basic Steps in Case-Control Study
I. Selection of Cases and Controls
Definition of a case
:
Diagnostic criteria of the disease
: The diagnostic criteria of the
disease and stage, if any, to be included in the study must be
specified before the study is undertaken and should not be
altered or changed until the study is over.
Eligibility criteria
: Only newly diagnosed cases within a
specified period of time are eligible than old cases or cases in
advanced stages of disease.
Source of cases
:
 Cases may be drawn from:
Hospitals
:
 Often it is convenient to select from hospital
admitted during a specified period of time.
General population
:
 All cases of the study disease, occurring
within a defined geographic area during a specified period of
time are ascertained, often through a survey, a disease registry or
hospital network. The entire case series or a random sample of it
is selected for the study.
Selection of controls
:
 Controls must be free from the disease under
study. Similar to the cases, except for the absence of disease. Controls
should comprise of persons who have not been exposed to the disease
or some other factor whose influence is being studied.
Sources of controls
Hospital controls
:
 Controls may be selected from the same hospital as
the cases, but with different illnesses other than the study disease.
Relatives
:
 Sibling controls are unsuitable where genetic conditions are
under study
Neighbourhood controls
:
 Controls may be people living in same
locality as cases, persons working in the same factory, children
attending same school.
General population
:
 Population controls can be obtained from defined

=== PAGE 336 ===
1.
2.
geographic areas, by taking a random sample of individuals free of the
study disease.
5
Failure to select comparable controls can introduce “bias” into results of
case control studies and decrease the confidence one can place in the
findings.
II. Matching
Matching is defined as the process by which we select controls in such a way
that they are similar to cases with regards to certain pertinent selection
variables (e.g. sex, age) which is known to influence the outcome of disease
and which, if not adequately matched for comparability, could distort or
confound the results.
A ‘confounding factors’ is defined as one, which is associated both with
exposure and disease, and is distributed unequally in study and control
groups. For example, role of alcohol in the aetiology of oesophageal cancer,
smoking is a confounding factor because: (1) It is associated with the
consumption of alcohol and (2) it is an independent risk factor for
oesophageal cancer. The effects of alcohol consumption can be determined
only if the influence of smoking is neutralized by matching.
While matching it should be borne in mind that the suspected aetiological
factor or variable we wish to measure should not be matched, because by
matching, its aetiological role is eliminated in that study. There are several
kinds of matching procedures.
2
Group matching
:
 This may be done by assigning cases to
subcategories based on their characteristics (e.g. age, occupation, social
class) and then establishing appropriate controls. The frequency
distribution of the matched variable must be similar in study and
comparison groups.
By pairs
:
 For each case, a control is chosen which can be matched
quite closely. Thus, if we have a 50-year-old mason with a particular
disease, we will search for 50-year-old mason without disease as a
control. Thus one can obtain pairs of patients and controls of the same
sex, age, duration and severity of illness, etc.
III. Measurement of Exposure

=== PAGE 337 ===

2.
Information about exposure should be obtained in precisely the same manner
for both cases and controls. This may be obtained by: (1) Interviews, (2)
Questionnaires, (3) Past records (cases and controls).
IV. Analysis and Interpretation
Exposure rates in (1) cases = a/(a + c), (2) controls = b/(b + d) (
Table
7.2
).
The estimation of disease risk
Relative risk
= a/(a + b)/c/(c + d) (
Table 7.2
)
Odds ratio is a measure of the strength of the association
between risk factor and outcome = ad/bc

Bias in Case Control Study
Bias is any systematic error in the determination of the association between
the exposure and the disease. Some of these are:
Memory or recall bias
:
 When cases and controls are asked questions
about their past history, it may be more likely for the cases to recall the
existence of certain events or factors than the controls who are healthy
persons.
Selection bias
:
 The cases and controls may not be representative of
cases and controls in the general population. There may be systematic
differences in characteristics between cases and controls. The selection
bias can be best controlled by prevention.
Interviewer’s bias
:
 Bias may also occur when the interviewer knows
the hypothesis and also knows who the cases are. This prior
information may lead him to question the cases more thoroughly than
controls regarding a positive history of the suspected causal factor.
This type of bias can be eliminated by double-blinding.
Bias due to confounding
:
 Confounding is an important source of bias.
This bias can be removed by matching in case control studies.
Berkesonian bias
:
 This bias arises because of the different rates of
admission to hospitals for people with different diseases. It is termed
after Dr. Joseph Berkesonian who recognized this problem.
Case Control Study-Advantages
Easy to carry out
Rapid and inexpensive
Few subjects are required
Rare disease can be studied
No risk to subjects
Allows study of several aetiological factor
Risk factors can be identified
No attrition problems
Ethical problems are minimal

Disadvantages
Problems of bias
Selection of appropriate control group
Incidence cannot be measured
Not distinguished between causes and associated factors
Not suited to the evaluation of therapy
Concern is representativeness of cases and controls, e.g. (1)
thalidomide tragedy, (2) maternal smoking and congenital
malformations.

2. Cohort Study
Cohort study is known by a number of names:
Prospective study, longitudinal study, incidence study, forward-looking
study.
‘Cohort’ is defined as a group of people who share a common
characteristic or experience within a defined time period, e.g. age, sex,
occupation, exposure to drug or vaccine.
Distinguishing Features
The cohorts are identified prior to the appearance of the disease under
investigation.
The study groups are observed over a period of time to determine the
frequency of the disease among them.
The study proceeds forward from cause to effect.
Indications for Cohort Study
When there is good evidence of an association between exposure and
disease, supported by descriptive and case control studies.
When exposure is rare, but the incidence of disease is high among the
exposed.
When attrition of study population can be minimized.
When ample funds are available.
If the incidence of the disease in the exposed group = a/(a + b) is
significantly higher than in the non-exposed group = c/(c + d), it would
suggest that the disease and cause suspected are associated (
Table 7.3
).

Types of Cohort Studies
Prospective cohort study
:
 In this study, the outcome (disease) has not
yet occurred at the time the investigation begins. These studies begin in
the present and continue into the future.
Retrospective cohort study
:
 In this study, the outcomes have all
occurred before he start of the investigation. It is known by a variety of
names like ‘historical’ cohort study, prospective study in retrospect and
non-concurrent prospective study.
Combination of retrospective and prospective cohort study
:
 The
cohort is identified from past records and is assessed of date for the
outcome. The same cohort is followed up prospectively into future for
further assessment of outcome.
3
Elements of a Cohort Study
Selection of study subjects
:
 Study subjects may be selected from (a)
the general population—when exposure or cause of death is fairly
frequent in the population, (b) special groups like select groups
(professional groups) or exposure group (radiologist exposed to X-
rays).
Obtaining data on exposure
:
 Information about exposure may be
obtained through, survey, interviews, questionnaires, medical records,
or environmental surveys. Information about exposure allow
classification of cohort members:
Whether or not they have been exposed to the suspected factor.
According to level or degree of exposure, at least in broad
classes, in the case of special exposure group.
Selection of comparison group
:
 There are many ways of assembling
comparison groups:
Internal comparisons
:
 In some cohort studies, no outside
comparison group is required. That is single cohort enters the
study, and its members may, on the basis of information
obtained, be classified into several comparison groups according
to the degrees or levels of exposure to risk (e.g. smoking—1
packet per day, 2 packets per day, etc. blood pressure) before the

=== PAGE 342 ===
2.

development of the diseases in question. The groups, so defined,
are compared in terms of their subsequent morbidity and
mortality rates.
External comparisons
:
 When information on degree of
exposure is not available, it is necessary to put up an external
control, to evaluate the experience of the exposed group, e.g.
smokers and nonsmokers, radiologists and ophthalmologists,
etc. The study and control cohorts should be similar in
demographic and possibly important variables other than those
under study.
Comparison with general population rates
:
 If none is available,
the mortality experience of the exposed group is compared with
the mortality experience of the general population in the same
geographic area as the exposed people. For example,
comparison of frequency of lung cancer among uranium mine
workers with lung cancer mortality in the general population
where the miners resided.
2
Follow-up
:
 Regular follow-up is required which comprise of periodic
medical examination, reviewing hospital records, surveillance of death
records, mailed questionnaires, telephone calls, periodic home visits—
preferably on an annual basis. The safest course recommended is to
achieve as close as 95 % follow-up as possible.
Analysis
:
 The data are analyzed in terms of:
Incidence rates of outcome among exposed = a/a + b and and
non-exposed = c/c + d (
Table 7.3
)
Estimation of risk
Relative risk
For example, RR = 10. Smokers are 10 times at greater risk of
developing lung cancer compared to non-smokers. Greater the relative
risk, greater the association.
Attributable risk = 90%, means 90% of lung cancer among
smokers was due to their smoking.

Population attributable risk = 86%. If risk factor of cigarettes
were avoided 86% of deaths from lung cancer could be avoided.
Advantages of Cohort Study
Incidence can be calculated.
Several possible outcome can be studied simultaneously.
Direct estimate of relative risk is possible.
Dose-response ratios can be calculated.
Bias can be minimized since comparison groups are formed before
disease develops.
Disadvantages
Involves large number of study subjects.
Longer time needed to complete the study.
Extensive record keeping needed.
Attrition problem among study population.
Selection of groups is a limiting factor.
Diagnostic criteria can change over prolonged follow-up.
Study is expensive.

III. EXPERIMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
Experimental epidemiology is often equated with randomized controlled
trials. The conditions in which study is carried out are under the direct control
of the investigator. Thus it involves some action, intervention or
manipulation such as deliberate application or withdrawal of the suspected
cause or changing one variable in the causative chain in the experimental
group while making no change in the control group, and observing and
comparing the outcome of the experiment in both the groups or withdrawal of
the suspected cause.

Aims
To provide “scientific proof” of aetiological factors
To provide a method of measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of
health services for the prevention, control and treatment of disease and
improve the health of the community.
Experimental studies are of two types
:
Randomized control trials (i.e. those involving a process of random
allocation).
Non-randomized or non-experimental trials (i.e. those departing from
strict randomization for practical purposes).

Steps in Randomized Controlled Trial
Drawing up a protocol
Selecting reference and experimental populations
Randomization
Manipulation or intervention
Follow-up
Assessment of outcome
1. Drawing Up a Protocol
One of the essential features of a randomized controlled trial is that the study
is conducted under a strict protocol. The protocol specifies the aims and
objectives of the study, questions to be answered, criteria for the selection of
the study and the control groups, size of the sample, the procedures for
allocation of subjects into study and control groups, treatments to be applied
—when and where and how to what kind of patients, standardization of
working procedures and schedules as well as responsibilities of the parties
involved in the trial, up to the stage of evaluation of outcome of the study.
The protocol aims that preventing bias and to reduce the sources of error in
the study.
2. Selecting Reference and Experimental Populations
Reference or target population
:
 It is the population to which the
findings of the trial, if found successful, are expected to be applicable.
Thus the reference population may comprise the population of a whole
city, or a population of school children, industrial workers, and so on
according to the nature of the study.
Experimental or study population
:
 The study population is derived
from the reference population. It is the actual population that
participates in the experimental study. Ideally, it should be randomly
chosen from the reference population, so that it has the same
characteristics as the reference population.
5
The participants or volunteers must fulfill the following three criteria:

=== PAGE 348 ===
a.
b.
c.
They must give “informed consent”.
They should be representative of the population to which they belong.
They should be qualified or eligible for the trial.
3. Randomization
Randomization is a statistical procedure by which the participants are
allocated into groups usually called “study” and “control” groups, to receive
or not to receive an experimental, preventive or therapeutic procedure,
manoeuvre or intervention. Randomization is an attempt to eliminate “bias”
and allow for comparability. Theoretically, it is possible to assure
comparability by matching. But when one matches, one can only match those
factors, which are, known to be important. Randomization ensures that the
investigator has no control over allocation of participants to either study or
control group, thus eliminating what is known as “selection bias”.
In randomization, every individual gets an equal chance of being
allocated into either group or any of the trial groups. Randomization is best
done by using a table of random numbers.
4. Manipulation
Having formed the study and control groups, the next step is to intervene or
manipulate the experimental group by the deliberate application of
withdrawal or reduction of the suspected causal factor (e.g. this may be a
drug) as laid down in the protocol.
5. Follow-up
This implies the examination of the experimental and the control group
subjects at defined intervals of time, in a standard manner, with equal
intensity, under the same given circumstances, in the same time frame till the
final assessment of outcome. Thus the follow-up may be short or may require
many years depending upon the study undertaken. It may be mentioned that
some losses to follow-up are inevitable due to factors, such as death,
migration and loss of interest. This is known as attrition. Every effort should
be made to minimize the losses to follow-up.

=== PAGE 349 ===

6. Assessment
The final step is the assessment of the outcome of the trial in terms of
positive results/negative results. The incidence of positive and negative
results is rigorously compared in both the groups, and the differences, if any,
are tested for statistical significance.

Blinding Technique
Bias may arise from errors of assessment of the outcome due to human
element. These may be bias on the part of the participants, may be observer
bias, and may be bias in evaluation. Randomization cannot guard against
these sorts of bias, or the size of the sample. In order to reduce these
problems, a technique known as “blinding” is adopted, which will ensure that
the outcome is assessed objectively. Blinding can be done in three ways:
Single blind trial
:
 The trial is so planned that the participant is not
aware whether he belongs to the study group or control group.
Double blind trial
:
 The trial is so planned that neither the doctor nor
the participant is aware of the group allocation and the treatment
received.
Triple blind trial
:
 This goes one step further. The participant, the
investigator and the person analyzing the data are all “blind”. Ideally,
of course, triple-blinding should be used; but the double-blinding is the
most frequently used method when a blind trial is conducted.
Types of Randomized Controlled Trials
Clinical trials
Preventive trials
Risk factor trials
Cessation experiments
Trial of aetiological agents
Evaluation of health services.
Clinical trials
:
 When a new treatment has been developed it is important to
provide answers to 2 questions: (1) Does it work? (2) Is it better than the
existing treatment?
To answer these, clinical trials must be carried out. The first stage is to
conduct an experimental clinical trial in which the effectiveness of the
treatment is measured under ideal conditions. A fissure sealant, for example,
may be tested in older children using premolar teeth and the clinical operation
performed by the researcher. However, even if the results of an experimental

=== PAGE 351 ===
1.
2.
clinical trial are encouraging, the results are only applicable under these ideal
conditions. Under normal conditions, the fissure sealant would often be
applied to the molars of younger children and the technique performed by a
variety of clinicians. It is, therefore, necessary to carry out a community
clinical trial or field trial, which is designed to measure the efficacy of the
agent under real life conditions. This enables the investigator to decide
whether the new form of treatment is a more efficient use of resources than
the existing treatment.

suspected factor may not be real.
Indirect association
:
 The indirect association is a statistical association
between a characteristic or variable of interest and a disease due to the
presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both
the characteristic and the disease.
Direct (causal) association
One-to-one causal relationship
:
 Suggests that when the factor
A is present, the disease B must result. Conversely, when the
disease is present, the factor must also be present.
Multifactorial causation
:
 Here the causal factors act
cumulatively to produce the disease. For example, smoking, air
pollution, exposure to asbestos cause lung cancer.

THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST
If epidemiology is taken in its broadest sense, any researcher into the
occurrence of disease or disability in groups of people is in fact an
epidemiologist. Only large health departments, however, can usually afford
specialists in this field.
According to Smillie, an epidemiologist should have the five following
qualifications:
He should be familiar with statistical techniques.
He should be well grounded in the diagnosis of disease.
He should be familiar with the history of medicine, particularly that
portion of it that relates to epidemics of disease.
He should have a good knowledge of bacteriology, and immunology
and a thorough understanding of physiology, particularly in relation to
the various environmental factors that may influence the health of
individuals.
He must develop a point of view, which will interrelate disease
processes as they affect the community as a unit, rather than the
individual. Thus he must have a real knowledge of the principles of
preventive medicine.
The epidemiologist is essentially a planner. Data come to him from many
sources and his recommendations may be carried out by a great variety of
different personnel, such as physicians, sanitarians, dentists, school nurses,
government regulatory bodies, and the like. The epidemiologist, however,
must keep close supervision over the collection of data and also serve as
consultant to those in the field of public health administration. It is he who
must determine when an epidemic of disease starts and when it has ceased to
exist. He may not be able to do very much about the actual control of the
epidemic once it has started, but if not, it is he who should apply the lessons
learned to the design of measures which will prevent future epidemics.

TERMINOLOGIES IN EPIDEMIOLOGY
Communicable disease
:
 An illness due to a specific infectious agent or its
toxic products capable of being directly or indirectly transmitted from man to
man, animal to animal, or from the environment to man and animal.
Epidemic
: The unusual occurrence is a community or region of disease,
specific health-related behaviour (e.g. smoking), or other health-related
events (e.g. traffic accidents) clearly in excess of “expected occurrence”.
Endemic
: It refers to the constant presence of a disease or infectious agent
within a given geographic area or population group, without importation from
outside.
Sporadic
: The word sporadic means scattered about. The cases occur
irregularly, haphazardly from time to time, and generally infrequently.
Infection
: The entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent
in the body of man or animal.
Contamination
: The presence of an infectious agent on a body surface, also
on or in clothes, beddings, toys, surgical instruments or dressings, or other
inanimate articles or substances including water, milk and food.
Infectious disease

 A clinically manifest disease of man or animals resulting
from an infection.
Contagious disease
:
 A disease that is transmitted through contact, e.g.
scabies, trachoma, STD and leprosy.
Pandemic
: An epidemic usually affecting a large proportion of the
population, occurring over a wide geographic area such as a section of a
nation, the entire nation, a continent or the world, e.g. influenza pandemics of
1918 and 1957.

Opportunistic infection
:
 This is infection by an organism that takes the
opportunity provided by a defect in host defence to infect the host and hence
cause disease.
Iatrogenic disease
:
 Any untoward or adverse consequence of a preventive,
diagnostic or therapeutic regimen or procedure, that causes impairment,
handicap, disability or death resulting from a physician’s professional activity
or from the professional activity of other health professionals.
Investigation of epidemic
:
 The “
unusual
” occurrence in a community or
region of disease, specific health-related behaviour (e.g. smoking) or other
health-related events (e.g. traffic accidents) clearly in excess of “
expected
occurrence
”.
The amount of disease occurring in the past, in the absence of an
epidemic is called 
expected frequency
.
Outbreak
 is term used for a small usually localized epidemic in the
interest of minimizing public alarm, unless the number of cases is indeed
very large.
Characteristics of epidemic
:
Epidemic includes any kind of disease.
There is no universally applicable number. of cases which constitute an
epidemic.
There is no specification of geographic extent.
It may encompass any time period.
Objective of an epidemic investigation
:
To define the magnitude of the epidemic outbreak or involvement in
terms of time, place and person.
To determine the particular conditions and factors responsible for the
occurrence of the epidemic.
To identify the cause, source of infection and modes of transmission to
determine measures necessary to control the epidemic.
To make recommendations to prevent recurrence.

STEPS IN INVESTIGATION OF AN EPIDEMIC
Frequently, epidemic investigations are called for after the peak of the
epidemic has occurred; in such cases, the investigation is mainly
retrospective. No step by step approach applicable in all situations can be
described like a “cook-book”.
However, in investigating an epidemic, it is desired to have an orderly
procedure or practical guidelines.
Verification of diagnosis
Confirmation of the existence of an epidemic
Defining the population at risk
Rapid search for all cases and their characteristics
Data analysis
Formulation of hypotheses
Testing of hypotheses
Evaluation of ecological factors
Further investigation of population at risk
Writing the report
Verification of diagnosis
:
 It is the first step in an epidemic
investigation, as it may happen sometimes that the report may be
spurious, and arise from misinterpretation of signs and symptoms by
the lay public. It is, therefore, necessary to have the verification of
diagnosis on the spot as quickly as possible. It is not necessary to
examine all the cases to arrive at the diagnosis. A clinical examination
of a sample of cases may well suffice. Laboratory investigations,
wherever applicable, are most useful to confirm the diagnosis but the
epidemiological investigations should not be delayed until the
laboratory results are available.
Confirmation of the existence of an epidemic
:
 The next step is to
confirm, if epidemic exists. This is done by comparing the disease
frequencies during the same period of previous years. An epidemic is
said to exist when the number of cases (observed frequencies) is in
excess of the expected frequency for that population based on the past

=== PAGE 358 ===

experience. An arbitrary limit of two standard errors from an endemic
occurrence is used to define the epidemic threshold for common
diseases such as influenza. Often the existence of an epidemic is
obvious needing no such comparison as in the case of common source
epidemics of cholera, food poisoning and hepatitis A. These epidemics
are easily recognized. In contrast, the existence of modern epidemics
(e.g. cancer, cardiovascular diseases) is not easily recognized unless
comparison is made with previous experience.
Defining the population at risk
:
Obtaining a map of the area
: Before beginning the investigation,
it is necessary to have a detailed and current map of the area. If
this is not available, it may be necessary to prepare such a map.
It should contain information concerning natural landmarks,
roads and the location of all dwelling units along each road or in
isolated areas. The area may be divided into segments, using
natural landmarks as boundaries. This may again be divided into
smaller sections. Within each section, the dwelling units
(houses) may be designated by numbers.
Counting the population
: The denominator may be related to the
entire population or subgroups of a population. It may also be
related to total events. For example, if the denominator is the
entire population on a complete census of the population by age
and sex should be carried out in the defined area by house to
house visits. For this purpose, lay health workers in sufficient
numbers may be employed. Using this technique, it is possible
to establish the size of the population. The population census
will help in computing the much-needed attack rates in various
groups and subgroups of the population later on. Without an
appropriate denominator of “population at risk” attack rates
cannot be calculated.
Rapid search for all cases and their characteristics
:
Medical survey
: Concurrently, a medical survey should be
carried out in the defined area to identify all cases including
those who have not sought medical care, and those possibly
exposed to risk. Ideally, the complete survey (screening each
question) will pick up all affected individuals with symptoms or

=== PAGE 359 ===
b.
c.
5.
a.
b.
signs of the disorder. Lay health workers may be trained to
administer the ‘epidemiological case sheet’ or questionnaire to
collect data.
Epidemiological case sheet
: The epidemiologist should be
armed with an ‘epidemiological case sheet’ for collecting data
from cases and from persons apparently exposed but unaffected.
The epidemiological case sheet or ‘case interview form’ should
be carefully designed (based on the findings of a rapid
preliminary inquiry) to collect relevant information. This
includes: name, age, sex, occupation, social class, travel, history
of previous exposure, time of onset of disease, signs and
symptoms of illness, personal contact at home, work, school and
other places; special events such as parties attended, food eaten
and exposure to common vehicles such as water, food and milk;
visits out of the community, history of receiving injections or
blood products, attendance at large gathering, etc. the
information collected should be relevant to the disease under
study. For example, if the disease is food-borne, detailed food
histories are necessary. A case review form will ensure
completeness and consistency of data collection.
If the outbreak is large, it may not be possible to interview all
the cases (e.g. influenza). In such cases, a random sample should
be examined and data collected.
Searching for more cases
: The patient may be asked, if he knew
of other cases in the home, family, neighbourhood, school, work
place having an onset within the incubation of the index case.
Cases admitted to the local hospitals should also be taken into
consideration. This may reveal not only additional cases but also
person to person spread.
Data analysis
:
 The data should be analyzed on ongoing basis, using
the classical epidemiological parameters—time, place and person.
Time
:
 Epidemic curve—chronological distribution of dates of
onset and construct. Look for time clustering of cases.
Place
:
 Prepare a spot map (geographic distribution) of cases and
if possible, their relation to possible source of infection

Person
:
 Analyze the data by age, sex, occupation, and other
possible risk factors. Determine the attack rates/cases, fatality
rates, for those exposed and those not exposed and according to
host factors.
Formulation of hypotheses
:
 A hypothesis is an educated “guess” about
the source of the outbreak. Generating hypotheses enable the
investigators to test these hypotheses in an analytic study. The success
of the investigation depends upon the quality of the hypotheses. On the
basis of time, place and person distribution or the agent-host-
environment model, formulate hypotheses to explain the epidemic in
terms of:
Possible source
Causative agent
Possible modes of spread
The environmental factors which enabled it to occur
Formulation of a tentative hypothesis should guide further investigation.
Testing of hypotheses: Intensive follow-up
:
Evaluate in more details clinical, pathological, microbiological
toxicological data
Same for previously collected data 
Further epidemiological
studies
Retrospective cohort study
Case-control study
Environmental sampling
Collect appropriate samples
Allow epidemiological data to guide testing
If analytic study results are conclusive, don’t wait for positive
samples before implementing prevention.
Evaluation of ecological factors
:
 An investigation of the
circumstances involved should be carried out to undertake appropriate
measures to prevent further transmission of disease.
Further investigation of population at risk
:
 A study of the population

at risk or a sample of it may be needed to obtain additional
information. This may involve medical examination, screening tests,
examination of suspected food, faeces or blood samples, biochemical
studies, assessment of immunity status, etc. This will permit
classification of all members as to:
Exposure to specific potential vehicles
Whether ill or not
Writing the report
:
 The report should be complete and convincing. It is
important for the concerned officials to make appropriate and timely
reports to higher authorities.
This has two main uses:
It keep the authorities at the higher level informed so that they
can make the appropriate decisions.
It helps to review the outbreak and response, identify system
failures and take corrective measures so that similar events are
not repeated.
Thus reports are an important learning tool and should not be
seen as a mindless chore. But for this to happen, the authorities
at the appropriate level should read the reports and take the
necessary action.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND
PREVENTION OF DENTAL CARIES
Dental caries is an infectious microbial disease that results in localized
dissolution and destruction of calcified tissues of the teeth. The enzymes
produced by the bacteria act upon the fermentable carbohydrates to produce
acids. These acids react with the enamel leading to dental caries as a result of
demineralization.

=== PAGE 367 ===
Epidemiology
Dental caries may be considered a disease of modern civilization. Studies
revealed that the skulls of men from pre-neolithic period (12,000 BC) did not
exhibit dental caries but skulls from Neolithic period (12,000 to 3000 BC)
contained carious teeth. Dental caries was also found in the skulls of
Neanderthal age (3000 BC – 750 BC). Evidence of caries was found in about
one-half of the 24 skulls of the prehistoric race, which lived in Central
Europe about 15,000 years ago.

Aetiology of Dental Caries—Theories
The Legend of the Worm
The earliest reference to tooth decay and toothache came from the ancient
Sumerian text known as ‘The Legend of the Worm’. It was obtained from the
Mesopotamian areas which dates to about 5000 BC. The early history of
India, Egypt and the writing of Homer also makes reference to the worm as
the cause of toothache. Chinese and Egyptians used fumigation devices for
treatment of dental caries.
1
Endogenous Theories
Humoral theory
:
 The four humours of the body were blood, phlegm,
black bile and yellow bile. According to Galen, the ancient Greek
physician and philosopher, “dental caries is produced by internal action
of acid and corroding humors”. Hippocrates, the father of medicine,
while favouring the concept of humoural pathology, also referred to the
accumulated debris around teeth and to their corroding action. He also
stated that stagnation of juices in the teeth was the cause of toothache.
2
Vital theory
:
 Proposed during the 18
th
 century. According to this
theory, it is postulated that tooth decay originated like bone gangrene,
from within the tooth itself.
Exogenous Theories
Chemical (acid) theory
:
 In the 17
th
 and 18
th
 centuries there emerged
the concept that teeth were destroyed by acids formed in the oral cavity
by fermentation of food particles around teeth.
Parasitic (septic) theory
:
 Indicated that microorganisms were
associated with the carious process.
Miller’s chemicoparasitic theory (acido-genic theory)
:
 This theory
was proposed by WD Miller in 1890. The microorganisms found in the
oral cavity produce enzymes that act upon the fermentable
carbohydrates to produce acids (like lactic acid, butyric acid, formic
acid, succinic acid). These acids act upon the enamel of the tooth

=== PAGE 369 ===

resulting in its demineralization leading to dental caries.
1
Proteolysis theory
:
 Proposed by Gottileb in 1934. According to this
theory, the organic matrix would be attacked, before the mineral phase
of the enamel. The proteolytic enzymes liberated by the oral bacteria
destroy the organic matrix of enamel, loosening the apatite crystals, so
they are eventually lost and tissue collapses.
2
Proteolysis chelation theory
:
 Originated by Schatz and Martin in 1955.
It proposes that some of the products of bacterial action on enamel,
dentin and salivary constituents can form chelates with calcium. Since
chelates can be formed at neutral or alkaline pH, the theory suggested
that demineralization of the enamel could arise without acid formation.

=== PAGE 370 ===

Epidemiological Triad
I. Host Factors
Tooth
:
 
Composition
: The enamel consists of 96% inorganic matter and
4% water and organic matter. The dentin consists of 35% of organic
matter and water and 65% of inorganic matter. The cementum consists
of 45 to 50% of inorganic matter and 50 to 55% of organic matter and
water.
Morphology
: Presence of deep, narrow, occlusal fissures or buccal and
lingual pits tends to trap food, bacteria and debris. Since defects are
common in the base of fissures, caries may develop rapidly in these
areas. Conversely, as attrition advances, the inclined planes become
flattened, providing less opportunity for entrapment of food in the
fissures and caries predisposition diminishes. Alteration of tooth
structure by disturbance in formation or in calcification is of only
secondary importance in dental caries. The rate of caries progression
may be influenced, but initiation of caries is affected very little.
3
Saliva
:
 It helps in removal of bacteria and food debris by its flushing
action. The quantities of inorganic and organic constituents of saliva
vary from person to person.
Calcium and phosphorus
: The quantity of calcium and phosphorus is
inversely related to the rate of flow. Its quantity is less in case of caries
active individuals.
Ammonia
: As the quantity of ammonia decreases, caries activity
increases, because ammonia retards plaque formation and neutralizes
acid.
Urea
: Urea gets hydrolyzed to ammonium carbonate by urease which
has a neutralizing effect.
Ptyalin and amylase
: Help in the degradation of starches.
pH of saliva
: The pH of saliva depends on its bicarbonate content. As
the flow rate of saliva increases, the pH also increases. Saliva may be
slightly acidic as it is secreted at unstimulated flow rates but it may
reach a pH of 7.8 at high flow rates. Quantity of saliva secreted
normally is 700 to 800 ml/day. As the viscosity of saliva increases, the

=== PAGE 371 ===

6.

8.
9.
10.
caries activity also increases. The saliva also contains a number of
antibacterial substances or enzymes like lactoperoxidase, lysozyme,
lactoferrin, and IgA.
3
Sex
:
 Most of the studies have shown that dental caries is more
common in females.
Race
:
 Dental caries is more in whites compared to the blacks.
Age
:
 Though dental caries is considered to the disease with universal
prevalence, it is more commonly seen in childhood. Over 60 years of
age, root caries is seen which is mainly due to gingival recession and
deterioration of oral clearance ability.
Familial heredity
:
 Inheritance of a characteristic tooth structure has
lesser influence than environmental factors.
Developmental disturbances
:
 The presence of deep pits and fissures,
enamel hypoplasia and enamel defects make the tooth more prone to
dental caries.
Economic status
:
 In young primary school children, dental caries
decreases with increase in income. Among adults, as income decreases,
there is decrease in dental caries.
Concomitant disease
:
 Dental caries is found to be less in controlled
diabetes.
Oral hygiene habits
:
 Dental caries is found to be less among those
who maintain good oral hygiene.

II. Agent Factors
Consists of dental plaque forming streptococci (
Streptococcus mutans
).

Role of Microoganisms in Caries
They are a prerequisite for caries initiation.
A single type of microorganism is capable of inducing caries.
Acid production is a prerequisite for caries, but not all acidogenic
organisms are cario-genic.
Streptococcus
 strains produce extracellular dextrans or levans.
Organisms vary greatly in their capacity to induce caries.
Properties of Cariogenic Plaque
The rate of sucrose consumption was higher.
Synthesize more intracellular polysaccharides.
More lactic acid is formed.
Twice as much as extracellular polysaccharide is produced.
Higher levels of 
Streptococcus mutans
.
Lower levels of 
Streptococcus sanguis
 and 
Actinomyces
.

III. Environmental Factor
1. Diet
Diet is defined as the types and amounts of food eaten daily by an individual.
Difference in caries incidence was noted among populations with dissimilar
diets. Some dietary studies are given below.
A. 
Vipeholm study
:
 It was conducted by Gustafsson et al in 1954. It was
a five-year investigation of 436 adult inmates in a mental institution at the
Vipeholm hospital, Sweden. The institutional diet was nutritious, but
contained little sugar, with no provisions for between meal snacks. The dental
caries rate in the inmates was relatively low. The experimental design divided
the inmates into seven groups that is a control group, a sucrose group, a bread
group, a chocolate group, a caramel group, an 8 toffee group, a 24 toffee
group.
3
Conclusions of the study were
:
Increase in carbohydrate increased the level of dental caries.
The risk of caries is greater, if food was in a form that will be retained
on the tooth surfaces.
The risk of caries was greater, if sugar is consumed between meals.
The increase in caries activity varies between individuals.
Increased caries activity rapidly disappears upon withdrawal of sugar
rich foods.
A high concentration of sugar in solution and its prolonged retention on
tooth surfaces leads to increased caries activity.
The clearance time of the sugar correlates closely with caries activity.
Physical form and frequency of intake is important in cariogenicity
than total amount ingested.
B. 
Hopewood house study
:
 This study was conducted by Sullivan in
1958. The dental status of children between 3 and 14 years of age residing at
Hopewood House, New South Wales was studied longitudinally for 10 years.
The absence of meat and a rigid restriction of refined carbohydrate were the
two principal features of the Hopewood House diet. It was found that 53% of

=== PAGE 374 ===
1.
2.
3.
the children at the Hope-wood House were caries-free whereas only 0.4% of
the 13 years old, state school children were free from caries. The children,
oral hygiene was poor and gingivitis was prevalent in 75% of them. This
work shows that, in institutionalized children, at least, dental caries can be
reduced by diet, without the beneficial effects of fluoride and in the presence
of unfavourable oral hygiene.
2
C. 
Turku sugar study
:
 This study was conducted by Scheinin, Makinen
et al
 in 1975. In a 2-year feeding study, 125 young adults, divided into three
groups, consumed the entire dietary intake using these sugars exclusively:
Sucrose group 35 people, fructose group 38 people and xylitol group 52
people. A dramatic reduction in the incidence of dental caries was found after
2 years of xylitol consumption. Fructose was as cariogenic as sucrose for the
first 12 months but became less so at the end of 24 months. It was also found
that frequent between meal chewing of a xylitol gum produced an
anticariogenic effect.
2
D. 
Seventh-day adventist children study
:
 The seven day adventist had
certain restrictions in their diet which included the limitation of:
Sugar sticky elements
Highly refined starches
Between meal snacking
All the studies showed that the level of dental caries was much lower in
the Seven Day Adventist group compared to the other children.
E. 
Hereditary fructose intolerence
:
 Persons affected with this rare
metabolic disorder had learned to avoid any food that contains fructose or
sucrose, because the ingestion of these foods causes symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, tremor, etc. It was noted that the level of dental caries was lower in
this group compared to others.
1
Vitamins like A, D, K, B complex (B
6
), and calcium and phosphorus,
fluoride, amino acid like lysine and fats have an inhibitory effect on dental
caries.
2. Geographic Variations
Decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) is found to be decreasing in
developed countries, and increasing in developing countries. The use of

=== PAGE 375 ===
•
•
•
•
•
fluorides, oral hygiene practice and diet play a major role as a cause for this
difference.
3. Soil
Population depend largely on locally grown food products it is logical to look
to differences in soil consumption to help differences in caries experience.
Trace elements and dental caries
Caries promoting elements
: Se, Mg, Cd, Pt, Pb and Si.
Mildly cariostatic elements
:
 Vd, St, Ca, Bo, Li, Au.
Doubtful effect on caries
: Be, Co, Mn, Zn, Br and I.
Caries inert elements
:
 Ba, Al, Ni, Fe, Pd and Ti.
Strongly cariostatic elements
:
 F, phosphorus.
4. Urbanization
Dental caries is said to increase with urbanization.
5. Climate
Sunlight is said to decrease caries, UV light from sun is known to promote
vitamin D productions thus tend to reduce dental caries, whereas rainfall is
said to increase dental caries.
6. Social Factors
Good economic status and social pressure in the direction of good health
appearance are both strong factors in creating demand for dental treatment.
Effect of social pressure can be seen on an international basis by comparing
dentist-population ratios among civilised countries as well able to afford as
many dentists as may be considered important. A good economic status
carries with it a lower caries rate.
7. Industrial Hazards
Carbohydrate dust and acid fumes are both known to be deleterious to the
teeth, the one promoting caries and the other chemical erosion.

=== PAGE 376 ===
Dental Caries in India
Dental caries is a public health problem in India with a prevalence as high as
60–80% in Indian children, a figure far more than asthma. Apart from this,
about 30% of children suffer from malaligned teeth and jaws affecting proper
functioning of the dentofacial apparatus. Lack of awareness about dental
diseases has resulted in gross neglect of oral health. There is no component of
oral health in the present health care system. The grass-root level health
workers and doctors do not have adequate knowledge about oral hygiene and
prevention of orodental problems. All the above factors have resulted in poor
orodental health of our population.

Prevention and Control of Dental Caries
1. Increase the Resistance of the Teeth
Systemic use of fluoride
Fluoridation of water, milk and salt;
Fluoride supplementation in the form of tablets and lozenges; and
Consuming a fluoride-rich diet such as tea, fish, etc.
Topical
Use of fluoridated toothpaste and mouthwash;
Use of fluoride varnishes (in-office application, longer duration of
action, high fluoride content);
Use of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-
ACP), which is available as tooth mousse, helps to remineralize the
soft initial carious, demineralized areas of the teeth.
2. Combat the Microbial Plaque by Physical and
Chemical Methods
Physical methods
:
The correct method and frequency of brushing should be
followed—in the morning and before going to bed and
preferably after every major meal.
Tongue cleaning and the use of indigenous agents such as the
bark of neem or mango (where toothbrush and paste are
unaffordable) should be encouraged. The use of coarse
toothpowder and tobacco-containing dentifrices should be
avoided.
The use of various interdental cleaning aids such as dental floss,
interdental brush, water pik, etc. supplements the cleansing
effect of a toothbrush. Use of an electronic toothbrush in
children and persons with decreased manual dexterity is
recommended.

=== PAGE 380 ===
ii.
Chemical methods
:
 These include the use of a fluoride-containing
toothpaste, mouthrinses and 0.2% chlorhexidine and povidine-iodine
mouthwash. These should be used on prescription of a dental surgeon.
3. Modify the Diet
Reduce the intake and frequency of refined carbohydrates. Avoid sticky
foods and replace refined with unrefined natural food. Increase the intake of
fibrous food to stimulate salivary flow, which is protective against caries.
Consume caries-protective foods such as cheese, nuts, raw vegetables, fruits,
etc. Stimulate salivary flow with sugarfree chewing gum. Xylitol (a sugar
substitute)-containing chewing gum, if chewed between meals, produces an
anticaries effect by stimulating salivary flow.

=== PAGE 381 ===
Preventive Interventions
The use of pit and fissure sealants and application of fluoride varnish help in
slowing down the development of caries. Preventive restorations should be
carried out and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) should be used as a
community-based approach for the treatment and prevention of dental caries.

=== PAGE 382 ===

Miscellaneous Measures
These include the following:
Prevention of malocclusion (especially crowding of the teeth)
Prevention of premature loss of deciduous teeth
Restoration of missing permanent teeth by prostheses (dentures)
Making sugar-free chewing gum freely available and affordable in the
country
Using sugar substitutes such as saccharine, xylitol, mannitol,
aspartame, etc. in paediatric medicinal syrups, bakery products, jams,
marmalade, etc.
Making toothbrushes and fluoridated toothpaste available to the masses
at low cost. Regular use of fluoridated toothpaste is proven to reduce
the incidence of dental caries by 30%.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND
PREVENTION OF ORAL CANCER
Cancer may be regarded as a group of diseases characterized by:
Abnormal growth of cells.
Ability to invade adjacent tissues and even distant organs.
The eventual death of the affected patient, if the tumour has progressed
beyond the stage when it can be successfully removed.
Types of cancers
Carcinomas
Sarcomas
Lymphomas
Leukaemias

=== PAGE 385 ===
Oral Cancer
Oral cancer is one of the ten leading cancers in the world. In India, it is one of
the common cancers and is an important public health problem. Oral cancer
is classically described as an indurated, ulcerated lump or sore that may or
may not be painful and is often associated with cervical lymph adenopathy.
90 to 95% of all oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.
Epidemiology
India
:
 10% of 6,44,600 new cancers occurring all over the body is oral
cancer. On the basis of annual age-adjusted incidence rates, oral cancer ranks
from 1
st
 to 6
th
 among all cancers in different regions of India. The total
number of cancers at any time, however, is about 2.5 to 3 times the number
(6,44,600) estimated from the incidence rates. Annually almost 7% of all
cancer deaths in males and 4% in females have been reported to be due to
oral cancer.
In India, data is obtained from registries, which were set at Mumbai,
Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Bhopal, Pune, Chandigarh, and Trivandrum.
World
: In highly industrialized countries, it accounts for only 3–5% of all
cancers whereas in some developing countries, it is up to 40%.
Gender
:
 Males are more prone than females. In South East Asia, oral
cancer is the leading cancer in males and the 3
rd
 leading in females. In
developing countries, for males it is 2.5 times as many as industrialized
countries, and for females it is about 4 times.
Age
: Commonly seen in the 6
th
 decade of life.
Sites
:
 The site of occurrence of oral cancer is related to the customs and
social habits. In south and eastern India, cancer of the buccal mucosa has
been found to be more. The lateral border and undersurface of the tongue,
labial commissure and buccal mucosa are sites particularly associated with

=== PAGE 386 ===
betel-tobacco chewers. In Mumbai, the most common site reported was the
tongue, whereas in Chennai it was the buccal mucosa.

Age
:
 Older age shows increase incidence in carcinoma whereas the
younger age shows increase in sarcoma.
Race
:
 Whites develop lip melanoma more frequently than the blacks.
Certain odontogenic tumours are more common in black races.
Sex
:
 Cancer of lip is more common in women than in men. Malignant
melanoma is more common in women. Cancers of tongue and buccal
mucosa are more common in males.
Genetic factors
:
 Discovery of oncogenes introduced an era in which it
is possible to identify genetic elements involved in the initiation and
progression of malignant disease.
Occupation
:
 Textile workers show an increase in oral cancer. Male
leather workers show an increase in cancer of buccal cavity, larynx and
pharynx.
Immunity
:
 Kaposi sarcoma is more common in AIDS patients.
Social class
:
 There is a definite relationship between socioeconomic
status and frequency of cancer. Low-income groups show increase in
cancer of oral cavity.
Customs and habits
:
 Smoking (bidi) increases the incidence of cancer.
Reverse smoking increases the rate of cancer of palate. Tobacco
chewing, pan chewing, spicy food increase the rate of cancer of floor
of mouth and buccal mucosa. Alcohol consumption also increases the
chance for cancer.
II. Agent Factors
Biological
:
 (a) Virus (HIV, HSV), (b) Fungus (Candida).
Chemical
:
 Arsenic, dyes, nickel, aromatic amines, chromium.
Mechanical
:
 Sharp tooth, any other source of chronic irritation like ill
fitting dentures, chronic sores from jagged teeth, etc.

deficiency, increased consumption of red chilly powder, decrease in
copper, zinc, vegetables, vitamins E and C.
III. Environmental Factors
Water contaminants
:
 It includes some organic pollutants like
chloroform.
Air pollution
:
 Air pollution caused by the release of a number of gases
from the automobiles and factories, e.g. carbon dioxide.
Geographic variations
:
 In Netherlands, buccal mucosa is most
commonly affected and is more often seen in males. In Switzerland,
lip, tongues are the sites most affected and is often seen in males. In
Canadian Eskimos, cancer of salivary gland is more common. In
Srikakulam, and Visakapatnam, palatal cancer is most common.
Solar heat
:
 Prolonged exposure to sunlight causes melanoma.
Industrialization
:
 The release of various toxins by the industries
contaminates water and air, which may lead to cancer.

Tobacco
According to WHO, 90% of cancer in South East Asia is due to the use of
tobacco. In India, about 200 million people use tobacco in some form or the
other. Among them, 70% smoke bidis, 10% smoke cigarettes and 20% use
smokeless tobacco.
Smoking form of Tobacco
Bidi
:
 It is the most popular form of tobacco in India. About 0.2 to 0.3
gm of sundried tobacco flakes are hand-rolled in a rectangular piece of
temburni or tendu leaf and tied with a thread (
Fig. 8.1
). It is available
in lengths of about 60 mm and 80 mm. The nicotine content has been
estimated to be 1.7 to 3 mg.
Fig. 8.1:
 Rolling of bidi
Chillum
:
 It is a straight 10–14 cm long conical clay pipe used for
smoking tobacco. It is held vertically. It is filled with coarsely cut
tobacco pieces and a glowing charcoal is kept on top of tobacco (
Fig.
8.2
).

=== PAGE 390 ===

Fig. 8.2:
 Chillum
Chutta
:
 Cured tobacco wrapped in dried tobacco leaf. It is also called
as cigar and is a popular form of tobacco in certain parts of India.
Cigars are made of air cured, fermented tobacco usually in modern
factories (
Fig. 8.3
). Chutta are small cigars made of heavily bodied
tobacco.
Fig. 8.3:
 Cigar
Cigarettes
:
 About 1 gm of tobacco cured in the sun or artificial heat is

=== PAGE 391 ===

covered by paper. The tobacco is generally treated with variety of
sugars, flavouring and aromatic ingredients. They contain 1–1.4 mg of
nicotine. Only about 51% are filter tipped. The filters of Indian made
cigarettes comparatively trap less nicotine. Cigarette smoking is more
common in urban areas than in the rural areas (
Fig. 8.4
).
Fig. 8.4:
 Cigarette smoking
Dhumti
:
 Rolled leaf tobacco is used inside a leaf of jackfruit tree.
Sometimes dried leaf of the banana plant is used. This form of tobacco
is occasionally used for reverse smoking especially among women.
Commonly seen in Goa.
Hookah
:
 It is also called water pipe or hubble-bubble. It is purely of
Indian origin. The tobacco smoke is drawn through the water in the
base of the hookah, which cools and filters the smoke (
Fig. 8.5
).

=== PAGE 392 ===

Hookli
:
 It is a clay pipe of rather short stem varying from about 7–10
cm with a mouthpiece and bowl (
Fig. 8.6
). It is commonly used in
Bhavnagar district of Gujarat.
Fig. 8.6:
 Pipe used in smoking
Smokeless Tobacco (Fig. 87)
Khaini
:
 It is a powdered sun-dried tobacco, slaked lime (calcium
hydroxide) paste mixture occasionally used with areca nut. It is simply
placed in the mouth or chewed. This form of smokeless tobacco is
widespread in use in Maharastra.
Mainpuri tobacco
:
 Ingredients are tobacco, slaked lime, finely cut
arecanut, camphor, and cloves. About 7% of villages in parts of Uttar
Pradesh use this product.
Mawa
:
 It is a preparation containing thin shavings of arecanut with the
addition of some tobacco and slaked lime. It is usually sold wrapped in

=== PAGE 393 ===

cellophane papers and tied in the shape of a small ball. Before
consumption the packet is rubbed vigorously to mix the contents and
the mixture is chewed until it becomes softer after which it is
transferred to the mandibular groove.
Fig. 8.7:
 Smokeless forms of tobacco
Mishri
:
 It is prepared by roasting tobacco on a hot metal plate until it is
uniformly black. It is then powdered. It is used primarily to clean teeth.
Pan
:
 Pan chewing is the most common habit of smokeless tobacco
usage in India, which has its origin dating back to more than 2000
years. It refers to the betel leaf itself and often to the quid. The quid
contains arecanut, lime and according to local customs may also
include aniseed, cardamom, cinnamon, coconut, cloves, sugar and
tobacco wrapped in betel leaf.
Snuff
:
 It consists of finely powdered air-cured and fire-cured tobacco
leaves. It may be dry or moist, used plain or with other ingredients and
may be used orally or nasally. Bajjar is a dry snuff used by about 14%
of the women in Gujarat. It is carried in a metal container; a twig is
dipped into it and applied over the tooth and gingiva. Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon, nicotine, phenol, benzopyrene, carbon

=== PAGE 394 ===
monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and nitrosamine are some of the
important constituents in tobacco responsible for cancer.

Strategies for Cancer Prevention in India
Prevention means eliminating or minimizing exposure to the causes of
cancer, and includes reducing individual susceptibility to the effect of such
causes. This approach offers the greatest public health potential and the most
cost-effective long-term method of cancer control.
Tobacco is the single leading cause of cancer worldwide and in the fight
against cancer every country should give highest priority to tobacco control.
Educating people regarding the disease will help to drive away the fears
and stigma associated with the disease. It is important to involve all levels of
the population in the educational process. The following educational
strategies practiced by the Tata Memorial Hospital have produced very good
results and can be easily replicated by other cancer centres and also by
institutions and NGOs engaged in cancer control work.
Involvement of school children.
Involvement of youth and NSS students from university colleges.
Involvement of NGOs, particularly those working in the area of
women’s health.
Involvement of the municipal, district and state health administration.
Involvement of medical colleges, particularly departments of
preventive and social medicine.
Involvement of mass media. There are a variety of methods that can be
employed for educating people. Some of the useful ones that have
produced good results are:
Conducting drawing and essay competitions
: School children.
Debates, discussions, seminars and street play competitions
:
Youth and university students.
Participatory workshops and training sessions
: NGO groups,
municipal, district and state health administration.
Structured training and field activities
: Medical colleges.
Participatory programmes on radio and television
: Mass media.
Descriptive articles in newspapers and magazines
: Mass media.
Exhibitions and public lectures
: General population.

=== PAGE 397 ===
Well-illustrated audiovisual educational materials are extremely useful in
literate as well as illiterate populations. While health education is an
interesting method of communication, it should be clearly understood that
education is a process, which goes through the modalities of changes in
knowledge, attitudes and practices over a period of time and it takes a long
time before the impact of education becomes evident. On the other hand
sometimes even simple fact finding surveys can result in increased
knowledge leading to a reduction in morbidity and mortality. An interesting
example is a health education study conducted in two tehsils of Solapur
district in Maharashtra by the Tata Memorial Hospital Rural Cancer Registry
at Barshi. This study showed a reduction in mortality due to cervix cancer by
40% in a short span of 5 years.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, AETIOLOGY AND
PREVENTION OF PERIODONTAL DISEASES
Periodontal disease is a term, which includes all pathological conditions of
the periodontium (gingiva, alveolar bone, cementum and periodontal
ligament).
Traditionally, periodontal diseases were classified into gingival and
periodontal diseases.

=== PAGE 399 ===
Epidemiology of Periodontal Disease
Progress was slower in the field of periodontal diseases compared to dental
caries because unlike dental caries, periodontal disease does not lend itself
easily to objective measurement.

Changing Perceptions of Periodontal Diseases
In 1961, the expert committee of WHO said that gingivitis invariably
developed to periodontits. Research by 1990s showed that:
4
Severe periodontitis was seen only in a small proportion of the
population, whereas mild, and mild to moderate gingivitis were more
common.
Gingivitis and periodontitis are associated with bacterial flora that have
some similarities but also some differences. Gingivitis precedes
periodontitis. Fraction of sites and not all sites with gingivitis later
develop periodontitis.
Though periodontal disease is usually related to age, it is not a natural
consequence of aging.
Periodontal disease is not a major cause of tooth loss in adults.

Epidemiologic Indices
One of the most valuable techniques employed in study of the epidemiology
of periodontal diseases is the use of indices. Some of the indices used are:
Periodontal index
Periodontal disease index
Papillary-marginal attachment index
Gingival index
OHI-S
CPITN

Epidemiological Studies on Prevalence and Incidence of
Periodontal Diseases (India)
Many studies look at the prevalence of “advanced 
periodontitis
”, but have
differing definitions of this term. Generally though, severe forms of
periodontitis do not seem to affect more than 15% of the population of
industrialized
 countries. The proportion of such subjects increases with age
and seems to peak between 50 and 60 years. A later decline in prevalence
may be due to 
tooth loss
.
Periodontal disease in India is still one of the major causes of tooth loss.
There are a number of studies done on the prevalence of periodontal disease
by many professionals in India.
School going children
Handicapped children
Pregnant women
Adults
I. Among School Going Children
Nagaraj Rao et al (1980) conducted a study among 500 school children
of 5–10 years of age in Udupi and reported that oral hygiene status was
poor in all children. 28% of study population had marginal gingivitis
and 72% had chronic generalized gingivitis. Poor oral hygiene was
found to be the major factor for the increase in prevalence of gingivitis.
Nagaraj Rao (1985) studied oral hygiene status of school going
children of 4–14 years in Mysore. Results showed that oral hygiene
was better in girls than boys.
Pandit K et al (1986) examined 480 boys and girls of Delhi, aged 8–18
years using papillary marginal attachment index and found prevalence
of periodontal disease to be 41.7%. In the age group of 8–10 years, the
prevalence was found to be 42.2%, while in the age group of 11–13
years, it was 44.2% and above 14 years 54.6%. This study showed an
increase in prevalence with age.
Srivastava RP (1989) examined 690 subjects aged 6–17 years in Jhansi
and reported that 6–8 years age group had a prevalence of 42% and 15–

=== PAGE 403 ===
5.
1.
2.
1.
1.
2.
17 years age group had a prevalence of 94.02% indicating an increase
in prevalence with age.
Borle RM et al (1990) examined 1240 tribal students in Wardha district
of Madhya Pradesh and found that raw food decreased the prevalence
of periodontal disease.
II. Among Handicapped Children
Mehrotra AK et al (1982) examined 61 physically handicapped and 66
mentally retarded individuals using Russell’s Index. Among physically
handicapped children, the prevalence of periodontal disease was 88.5%
as compared to 100% in mentally retarded subjects. They reported that
the greater prevalence was due to lack of awareness of oral hygiene.
In 1991, a total of 466 children 11–14 years of age in Mumbai
consisting of mentally subnormal, physically handicapped, juvenile
delinquents and normal children were examined and periodontal
disease was found 100% in mentally subnormal, 95.95% in juvenile
delinquents and 97.38% among physically handicapped. The
periodontal status of mentally abnormal children revealed that 7.45%
had pockets of 4–5 mm deep requiring surgical intervention. 60% of
the children had calculus deposits requiring oral prophylaxis.
III. Among Pregnant Women
Dixit J et al (1980) studied the occurrence and severity of gingivitis in
80 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women in the age group of 20–40
years in Lucknow. They found a significantly higher severity of
gingivitis in pregnant subject as compared to nonpregnant. They also
noted increase in severity in second trimester.
IV. Among Adults
Ramachandra et al (1973) surveyed 6,647 rural and 1,536 urban
population of Tamil Nadu and found that periodontal disease in both
the populations was high (95.3% and 95.5% respectively). Periodontal
index score was found to increase with age.
In 1990, Anil S, Hari S and Vijay Kumar T assessed the periodontal
conditions of 2756 subjects aged 15–44 years from urban and rural

=== PAGE 404 ===
3.
areas of Trivandrum using CPITN Index. They reported that calculus
and bleeding was more frequent (86%) in 15–19 years, shallow
pocketing in 80% of subjects in 25–29 years, deep pockets more than 6
mm in 33% in age group of 35–44 years.
Maily AK, Banarjee KL, and Pal TL (1994) examined 5960 subjects
aged 15–65 years in a rural population in West Bengal using CPITN
Index. The subjects selected were mostly poor farmers. Remarkable
finding was that there was relatively low percentage of people with
deep periodontal pockets. They found CPITN score 4 in only 2–3
subjects. On the other hand, calculus was wide spread.

Epidemiological Triad
I. Host Factors
Age
:
 Chronic destructive periodontal disease has been associated with
older age groups (>40 years).
Sex
:
 It is more common in males than in females.
Race
:
 Blacks are more affected than the whites.
Intraoral variations
:
 Gingivitis is more seen on the interproximal areas
than the buccal and lingual areas. The upper arch shows more
gingivitis compared to the lower arch (except lingual). On the facial
aspect, upper 1
st
 and 2
nd
 molars are more prone to gingivitis followed
by the lower anteriors and least is the lower 2
nd
 premolar. On the
lingual aspect, lower 1
st
 and 2
nd
 molars are the most prone to gingivitis,
followed by lower premolar and the least are the upper anteriors.
Gingivitis is more often seen on the right arch than on the left arch.
4
Severity of bone loss
: Incisor and molar areas are more severely
involved than canine and premolar areas. Maxillary teeth experience
more bone loss compared to the mandible (except anterior). Inter-
proximally bone loss is higher than the facial and lingual. Severely
affected are lower centrals and laterals and upper molars.
Endocrine changes
:
 Puberty, menstruation and pregnancy,
hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism increase the chances of
gingivitis.
Traumatic occlusion
:
 Sharp cusp acts as ‘plungers’ and lead to
periodontitis.
Food impaction
:
 Food impaction causes chronic gingivitis which if let
to continue lead to periodontal disease.
Tooth position
:
 Irregular alignment makes it difficult to keep these
areas clean. Sometimes the roots approach each other too closely. This
may allow for insufficient intervening alveolar support resulting in
early pocket formation.
Occupational habits
:
 Occupational habits like thread biting, holding
nails between teeth, etc. can have traumatic effects on the

=== PAGE 406 ===
10.
11.
12.
13.
14.
15.
1.
2.
periodontium.
Neuroses
:
 Bruxism, lip, cheek and nail biting also have traumatic
effects on the periodontium.
Use of tobacco
:
 The components present in tobacco lower the tissue
resistance and increase susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontal
diseases.
Misuse of toothbrush
:
 Improper use of toothbrush may not only cause
abrasion or recession of the gingival tissues but may also irritate
already inflamed tissues.
Concomitant disease
:
 There is a tendency towards alveolar bone
destruction in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Heavy metal
poisoning may accentuate gingivitis. Acute monocytic leukaemia,
pernicious anaemia cause gingivitis.
Income
:
 Periodontal disease increases with decrease in income.
Education
:
 Severity of periodontal disease and level of education are
inversely related.
II. Agent Factors
Plaque
Calculus
Dental plaque
:
 It is the primary aetiologic factor for periodontal disease. It is
defined as soft deposits that form the biofilm adhering to the tooth surface or
other hard surfaces in the oral cavity, including removable and fixed
restorations. Disruption of balance between plaque bacteria and host results
in periodontal disease.
Dental plaque is divided into supragingival and subgingival plaques.
Marginal plaque is responsible for gingivitis whereas supragingival and
tooth associated subgingival plaque is responsible for calculus and root
caries.
Tissue associated subgingival plaque is responsible for periodontitis. 1
gram of plaque contains 2 × 10
11
 bacteria. It also contains epithelial cells and
macrophages embedded in an organic and inorganic matrix.
Organic and inorganic materials are derived from saliva, crevicular fluid

=== PAGE 407 ===
1.
2.
1.
2.
3.
and bacterial products.
Accumulation of plaque is found to be more on gingival one-third of the
tooth surface, cracks, pits and fissures, overhanging restorations and around
malaligned teeth. The rate of formation and location vary according to the
oral hygiene practices, diet, salivary composition and rate of flow.
Calculus
: Calculus is an adherent calcified mass that forms on the surface of
natural teeth and dental prosthesis. It consists of mineralized plaque.
Calculus would be divided into:
Supragingival calculus
: It is white or whitish yellow in colour. It is
found to be maximum in the upper 1
st
 molars, followed by the lower
central and laterals and least in the upper anteriors. It can be easily
detached.
Subgingival calculus
: It is dark brown or greenish black in colour. It is
found to be maximum in lower central and laterals followed by upper
1
st
 molar, upper anteriors, and upper 2
nd
 molars. It is found to be least
in lower 1
st
 and 2
nd
 premolars, and lower 3
rd
 molar.
Calculus provides a fixed nidus for the continued accumulation of plaque.
III. Environmental Factors
Geographic variations
:
 Periodontal diseases are found to be high in
Chile, Jordan, India, Malaysia, Ceylon. It is found to be intermediate in
US (blacks), Columbia, Ethiopia, and Ecuador and low in US (whites),
primitive Eskimos of Alaska. Underdeveloped and dentist deprived
areas have increased scores for periodontal diseases.
Nutrition
:
 Avitaminosis C, niacin deficiency show higher prevalence
for periodontal diseases. ICNND (International Committee on
Nutrition for National Defence) said that there is no consistent
association between periodontal disease and nutrition items. Trend
towards a higher prevalence and severity of periodontal were found in
areas with protein malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. Nutrition is a
secondary factor.
Degree of urbanization
:
 Rural population seems to suffer more from
periodontal diseases compared to urban population.

=== PAGE 408 ===
4.
Stress
:
 Stress is said to predispose to acute necrotising ulcerative
gingivitis and is often seen in military groups and in exam going
students.

EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLASSIFICATION OF
AETIOLOGY AND PREVENTION OF
MALOCCLUSION
Normal alignment of teeth not only contributes to the oral health but also
goes a long way in the overall well-being and personality of an individual.
Correct tooth position is an important factor for aesthetics, function and for
overall preservation or restoration of dental health.

Epidemiology of Malocclusion
Prevalence of malocclusion is estimated to be higher in developed countries
as compared to developing and underdeveloped countries.
Distoclusion in India is very low in contrast to USA (34% in whites and
15% in blacks) and in Europe 29%. However, Indians have more tendencies
for class II relationship than Africans (4.26% in Nigeria). Class III
malocclusion is also much less prevalent in India compared to USA,
Netherlands and Kenya.
Malocclusion percentage is relatively low in deciduous dentition.
Incidence of normal occlusion in deciduous dentition is 51%; mixed 40% and
permanent dentition about 30%.

Prevention and Treatment
The prevention and treatment of dentofacial anomalies can be undertaken at
three levels (
Table 8.3
).
Primary prevention
—preventive orthodontics
Secondary prevention
—interceptive orthodontics
Tertiary prevention
—corrective orthodontic treatment by removable
and fixed appliances, and surgical orthodontics.
Primary Prevention
This includes control of harmful oral habits, and preservation and restoration
of primary and permanent dentition.
Secondary Prevention
Habit-breaking appliances should be used. Serial extractions, space
maintainers/regainers, and functional appliances to correct jaw relations are
other modalities. Frenectomies and simple appliances can be used to correct
anterior crossbites.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREVENTION OF DENTAL
FLUOROSIS
Enamel fluorosis is a subsurface enamel hypo-mineralization or porosity that
occurs when a child ingests above optimum amounts of fluoride while
enamel formation is occurring. Clinically, the appearance of enamel fluorosis
can vary from faint white flecks in its mildest presentation, to more
noticeable snow flaking or mottling of enamel, sometimes with
accompanying brown staining of enamel. A number of indices have been
developed to measure dental fluorosis the most commonly employed is the
Dean’s fluorosis index, commonly used in epidemiological surveys to assess
the prevalence of dental fluorosis, also Community Fluorosis Index given by
Dean in 1935 was used to assess the degree of enamel mottling in the
community.
The other commonly used indices in measurement of dental fluorosis are
Thylstrup and Fejereskov Index, Tooth Surface Index for Fluorosis, Fluorosis
Risk Index to assess the risk of developing dental dental fluorosis, Murray
and Shaw’s Index and Young’s Index.

=== PAGE 420 ===
Prevalence of Enamel Fluorosis
Contribution of fluoride had reduced the prevalence of dental caries,
paralleling this decline there has been an observed increase in the prevalence
of enamel fluorosis, Circa in a study found that in an optimally fluoridated
area, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is 16% especially in mild forms.

DENTAL FLUOROSIS IN INDIA
Shortt in 1937 conducted a study and found that four states, Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, are affected by fluorosis.
1986 additional 9 states were identified to be affected by fluorosis by
‘Water Mission’.
1990–1992—Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir were added to the list
leading to the total of 15 states.
At present more than 22 states are affected with dental fluorosis in India.
Out of 6 lakh villages in India, at least 50% of the villages have fluoride level
in water exceeding 1.0 ppm.
They are further divided by the prevalence of districts affected in each
state

Risk Factors for Enamel Fluorosis
Enamel is at risk of developing fluorosis only during its formation. Therefore,
only the ingestion of fluoride during the first 6 to 8 years of life can be a risk
factor for enamel fluorosis. Studies by Pendrys D and Mascerandes A has
demonstrated an association between the use of fluoride tooth paste by
preschool children and enamel fluorosis. This was due to the fact that
preschool children swallow much of dentrifices they put into their mouth.

Dental fluorosis of moderate or severe degree is of aesthetic concern for the
people. So, conservative aesthetic procedures like bleaching and veneering
are carried out. Dental caries is also found to increase in patients with
increased severity of dental fluorosis.

CHAPTER
9
Infection Control
and Sterilization
In utero the oral cavity is sterile but after birth within a few hours to 1 day a
simple oral flora develops. As the infant grows, there is continuing
introduction of microorganisms normal for an adult oral cavity.
Most of the salivary bacteria come from the dorsum of the tongue, but
some are from other mucous membranes. Much higher counts of
microorganisms are found in bacterial plaque, periodontal pockets and
carious lesions than in saliva.
The intact mucous membrane of the oral cavity protects against infection
to a degree. However, when the gingival tissues are inflamed and are
manipulated during instrumentation, microorganisms can be introduced into
the underlying tissues by way of the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket.
1
The infectious process
:
 A chain of events is required for the spread of an
infectious agent. These are:
I. Essential features for disease transmission
2
An infectious agent, the invading organisms (bacterium, virus, fungus,
rickettsia, or protozoa). Each organism has its own specific reaction in
an infected host.
A reservoir where the invading organism live and multiply. The
infectious agent has its own essential environment, which may be an
inanimate matter, an insect, or human cells or blood. For example, soil
is the reservoir for tetanus, and humans are the reservoir for herpetic
infections.

a.
A mode of escape, the port of exit from the reservoir. Organisms exit
through various body systems, such as the respiratory tract, or through
skin lesions. Escape from the bloodstream may be through skin
abrasions, hypodermic needles, or dental instruments.
A mode of transmission, which may be direct, person to person, or
indirect by way of an intermediate vehicle, such as contaminated hands
or hypodermic needle. Transmission by a droplet may be direct from
the respiratory tract of one person to the oral cavity of the receiving
host. Droplets also may pass indirectly to hands or inanimate object to
be transferred indirectly to the susceptible host.
A mode of entry, the port of entry of the infectious agent into the new
host. Modes of entry may be similar to modes of escape, such as the
respiratory tract, mucous membranes, or a break in the skin.
A susceptible host that does not have immunity to the invading
infectious agent.
II. Factors that influence the development of infection
The presence of an infectious agent does not lead inevitably to infection or
disease. Factors involved include, but are not limited to, the following:
Number of organisms and duration of exposure.
Virulence of the organisms: Their ability to survive interim exposure.
Immune status of the host; antibody response; defense cell reaction.
General physical health and the nutritional status of the host. In health,
disease is resisted, whereas in deprived state, the body can be
susceptible to infection.
III. Factors that alter normal defenses
The patient’s complete medical and dental history must be reviewed to
identify specific problems and take necessary precautions. Examples of
situations that alter the normal defenses are included under the following
topics.
Abnormal physical conditions
:
 A heart valve may be defective as a
result of a congenital or acquired condition. Such a valve may be
susceptible to infective endocarditis resulting from a bacteraemia

created during dental or dental hygiene instrumentation.
Systemic diseases
:
 Examples of systemic conditions in which
susceptibility to infection is increased are diabetes mellitus,
alcoholism, leukaemia, glomerulonephritis, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome and all causes of immunosuppression.
Drug therapy
:
 Certain drugs used in the treatment of systemic disease
alter the body’s defenses. Examples are steroids and chemotherapeutic
agents that are immunosuppressive. Special precautions, such a
prophylactic antibiotics, may be indicated to prevent infection.
Prostheses and transplants
:
 A patient with, for example, a joint
replacement, cardiac prosthesis ventriculoatrial shunt for
hydrocephalus or an organ transplant may require antibiotic
premedication.

=== PAGE 433 ===
AIRBORNE INFECTION
1
I. Dust-Borne Organisms
Clostridium tetani
 (tetanus bacillus, 
Staphylococcus aureus
, and enteric
bacteria are among the organisms that may travel in the dust brought in from
outside and that moves in and about dental treatment areas. When doors are
opened and closed and people pass in and out, dust in set into motion that can
settle on instruments, other objects or people.
Infectious microorganisms also reach dust from the oral cavities of
patients by way of large airborne particles. Dust-borne organisms can be
sources of contamination for dental instruments and the hands of dental
personnel.

II. Aerosol Production
Airborne particles are usually classified by size as either aerosols or spatter.
Aerosols
:
 A particle of a true aerosol is less than 50 mm in diameter,
and nearly all are less than 5 mm. Aerosols are biologic contaminants
that occur in solid or liquid form, are invisible, and remain suspended
in air for long periods.
Spatter
:
 Heavier large particles may remain airborne a relatively short
time because of their own size and weight. They drop or spatter on
objects, people and the floor. The spatter is composed of particles
greater than 50 mm in diameter.
Origin
:
 Aerosols and spatter are created during breathing, speaking,
coughing and sneezing. They are produced during all intraoral
procedures, including examination and manual scaling. When produced
by air spray, air-water spray, handpiece activity or ultrasonic scaling,
the number of aerosols increases to tremendous proportions.
Contents
:
Microorganisms
: An aerosol may contain a single organism or a
dump of microorganisms adhered to a dust or debris particle.
The organisms may be contained within a liquid droplet.
Particles from cavity preparation
: Tooth fragments;
microorganisms from saliva, plaque, and/or
oropharynx/nasopharynx; oil from a handpiece; and water from
the cooling equipment may be in aerosols following cavity
preparation.
Ultrasonic scaling
: Microorganisms found in the aerosols from
ultrasonic scalers include 
Staphylococcus aureus, S. albus
 and 
S.
pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans
, lactobacilli, actinomyces,
pneumococci and diphtheroids viruses which may be spread by
ultrasonic instruments.
Concentration
:
 Bacteria-laden aerosols and spatter are in greater
concentration close to the scene of instrumentation. The quantity
decreases with distance. The aerosols travel with air currents and,
therefore, move from room to room.

=== PAGE 435 ===

III. Prevention of Transmission
The control of airborne infection depends on elimination or limitation of the
organisms at their source, interruption of transmission, and protection of the
potentially susceptible recipient.
Pre-procedural oral hygiene measures
:
 Toothbrushing and using an
antiseptic mouthrinse reduce the numbers of bacteria contained in
aerosols.
Interruption of transmission
:
Use rubber dam, high-volume evacuation, and manual
instrumentation as much as possible.
Install air-control methods to supply adequate ventilation,
filtration, and relative humidity.
Employ vacuum cleaning to remove dirt and microorganisms
rather than dust-arousing housekeeping methods. The cleaner
must have a filter to prevent the escape of organisms after they
are suctioned.
Clean water
:
 Run water through all tubings to handpieces, ultrasonic
scalers, and air-water spray for at least 2 minutes at the start of the day
and at least 30 seconds after each appointment during the day.
Contamination by spatter and aerosols is reduced by this method.
Protection of the clinician
:
 The use of masks and protective eyewear
can prevent direct contact of spatter and aerosols with the faces of the
dental team.

=== PAGE 436 ===
INFECTION CONTROL: CLINICAL PROCEDURES
3
The success of a planned system for control of disease transmission depends
on the cooperative effort of each member of the dental health team. The aim
is to provide the highest level of infection control possible and practical that
will ensure a safe environment for both patient and clinician.

=== PAGE 437 ===

Objectives of Infection Control
The following are necessary to prevent the transmission of infectious agents
and eliminate cross-contamination.
Reduction of available pathogenic microorganisms to a level at which
the normal resistance mechanisms of the body may prevent infection.
Elimination of cross-contamination by breaking the chain of infection.
Application of universal precautions by treating each patient as if all
human blood and body fluids are known to be infectious for HIV, HBV
and other blood-borne pathogens.

Treatment Room Features
The design of many treatment rooms may not be conducive to ideal planning
for infection control. Changes can be made in routines so that updated,
preferred systems can be adapted. When renovations or a new dental officer
or clinic are anticipated, plans must reflect the most advanced knowledge
available relative to safety and disease control.
The objective is to have materials, shapes, and surface textures that
facilitate the effective use of infection control measures.

Bloodborne Pathogens Standard
This is the most frequently requested and referenced OSHA standard
affecting medical and dental offices. Some basic requirements of the OSHA
Bloodborne Pathogens standard include:
A written exposure control plan, to be updated annually.
Use of universal precautions.
Consideration, implementation and use of safer engineered needles and
sharps.
Use of engineering and work practice controls and appropriate personal
protective equipment (gloves, face and eye protection, gowns).
Hepatitis B vaccine provided to exposed employees at no cost.
Medical follow-up in the event of an “exposure incident.”
Use of labels or colour-coding for items such as sharps disposal boxes
and containers for regulated waste, contaminated laundry and certain
specimens.
Employee training.
Proper containment of all regulated waste.

Hazard Communication Standard
The hazard communication standard is sometimes called the “employee right-
to-know” standard. It requires employee access to hazard information. The
basic requirements include:
A written hazard communication programme.
A list of hazardous chemicals (such as alcohol, disinfectants,
anaesthetic agents, sterilants and mercury) used or stored in the office.
A copy of the material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each chemical
(obtained from the manufacturer) used or stored in the office.
Employee training.

Ionizing Radiation Standard
This standard applies to facilities that have an X-ray machine and requires the
following:
A survey of the types of radiation used in the facility, including X-rays.
Restricted areas to limit employee exposures.
Employees working in restricted areas must wear personal radiation
monitors such as film badges or pocket dosimeters.
Rooms and equipment may need to be labelled and equipped with
caution signs.

STERILIZATION
Sterilization is the process by which all forms of life are destroyed. All
materials and items cannot be treated by the same system of sterilization. The
various approved methods of sterilization are:
2
Moist heat: Stream under pressure
Dry heat
Chemical vapor
Ethylene oxide
The method for sterilization that is selected must provide complete
destruction of all microorganisms, viruses, and spores and yet must not
damage the instruments and other materials. The tests for sterilization
requires the use of selected test microorganisms that are put through a regular
cycle of sterilization and then are cultured. When no growth occurs, the
sterilizer has performed with maximum efficiency. At least weekly testing is
recommended.

Moist Heat: Steam Under Pressure
Destruction of microorganisms by heat takes place as a result of inactivation
of essential cellular proteins or enzymes. Moist heat causes coagulation of
protein.
Principles of Action
Sterilization is achieved by action of heat and moisture; pressure serves
only to attain high temperature.
Sterilization depends on the penetrating ability of steam. Air must be
excluded, otherwise steam penetration and heat transfer are prevented.
Space between objects is essential to ensure access for the steam.
Materials must be thoroughly cleaned and air-dried. Air discharge
occurs in a downward direction; load must be arranged for free passage
of steam towards the bottom of autoclave.
The temperature must remain at 121°C at 15 pounds pressure for 15
minutes after the meters show that proper pressure and temperature
have been reached. Use 30 minutes for heavy loads to ensure
penetration.
Advantages
All microorganisms, spores and viruses are destroyed quickly and
efficiently.
Most economical method of sterilization.
Disadvantages
May corrode carbon steel instruments, if precautions are not taken.
Unsuitable for oils or powders that are impervious to heat.

Dry Heat
The action of dry heat is oxidation.
Principles of Action
Sterilization is achieved by heat that is conducted from the exterior
surface to the interior of the object; the time required to penetrate
varies among materials.
Sterilization can result when the whole material is treated for a
sufficient length of time at the required temperature; therefore, timing
for sterilization must start when the entire contents of the sterilizer
have reached the peak temperature needed for that load.
A temperature of 160°C (320°F) maintained for 2 hours; 170°C for 1
hour. Timing must start after the desired temperature has been reached.
Care must be taken not to overheat because certain materials can be
affected. Temperatures over 160°C (320°F) may destroy the sharp
edges of cutting instruments.
Advantages
Useful for materials that cannot be subjected to steam under pressure.
When maintained at correct temperature it is well suited for sharp
instruments.
No corrosion as compared with steam under pressure.
Disadvantages
Long exposure time required; penetration slow and uneven.
High temperature is critical to certain materials.

Chemical Vapour Sterilizer
2
A complication of alcohols, formaldehyde, ketone, water + acetone heated
under pressure produces a gas that is effective as a strigling agent. Microbial
and viral destruction results from the permeation of the heated formaldehyde
and alcohol. Heavy, tightly wrapped or sealed packages would not permit the
penetration of the vapours. Minimum of 20 minutes with temperature from
127°C to 132°C with 20 to 40 pounds pressure in accord with manufacturer’s
directions.
Advantages
Corrosion—rust-free operation for carbon steel instruments.
Ability to sterilize in a relatively short total cycle.
Use of operation and care of the equipment.
Disadvantages
Cannot be used for materials or objects that can be altered by the
chemicals that make the vapour or that cannot withstand the high
temperature.
Adequate ventilation is needed; cannot use in a small room.
Slight odour, which is rarely objectionable.

BARRIERS FOR PATIENT AND CLINICIAN
(PERSONAL PROTECTION OF THE DENTAL
TEAM)
3
Screening for possible contagious disease is needed prior to an oral
examination of any clinical procedure.
The continuing health and productivity of dental personnel depend to a
large degree on the control of cross-contamination. Loss of work-time,
personal suffering, long-term systemic effects, and even exclusion from
continued practice are possible results from communicable diseases. The only
safe procedure is to practice defensively at all times, with specific precautions
for personal protection.

=== PAGE 449 ===
I. Immunization
A. Basic Schedule
The immunization schedule for infants and children may include protection
against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough),
measles, mumps and rubella (German measles).
B. Booster and Reimmunization
Each agent requires booster or reimmunization on a specific plan, which may
range from 1 to 10 years, or reimmunization only upon intimate contact or
exposure.
For tetanus boosters, intervals of 10 years are indicated. If an injury
occurs, however, a booster should be given on the day of the injury.

Periodic throat culture for possible haemolytic Streptococcus carrier.
Serologic test for herpes simplex virus I (HSV I) antibodies to
determine susceptibility to primary HSV.
B. Obtaining Tests
Obtaining tests when exposed to infectious diseases and seek immunization.
C. Written Records
Keep written records of immunization, reimmunization, and boosters; plan
for regular follow-up.

Clinical Attire
2
The wearing apparel of clinicians and their assistants is vulnerable to
contamination from splash, splatter, aerosols and patient contact. The gown
or uniform should be designed and cared for in a manner that will minimize
crosscontamination.
Sterile-clean Procedures
When a sterile-clean technique is followed in routine practice, personal
hygiene and cleanliness do not differ from that in the strict aseptic technique.
Gown, uniform or scrubsuit
:
 Gowns, uniforms or scrubsuits are
expected to be clean and maintained as free as possible from
contamination. Wearing clinic coats over street clothes, cannot be
recommended because of the exposure of the street clothes to
infectious material.
Solid, closed front
: The garment should be closed at the neck. The
fabric should be able to be washed commercially and withstand
washing with bleach.
No pockets
: Pockets are too readily available for placing contaminated
objects such as writing implements or keys. Gloved hands, prepared for
patient treatment, must be kept from touching objects or being placed
in pockets.
Long sleeves
: Hand, wrist, and forearm washing and scrubbing are
necessary in preparation for gloving. Long sleeves with fitted cuffs
permit protective gloves to extend over the cuffs.
Hair and head covering
:
 Hair must be worn off the shoulders and
back. When longer, it must be held within a head cover. Because the
hair is exposed to much contamination, an appropriate head cover is
advised when using handpieces, ultrasonic or abrasive instruments.
Protection of uniform
:
 A plastic, washable or a disposable apron may
be used when clinical services are performed that usually involve
blood, splatter or aerosols.
Outside wear
:
 Clinic uniforms and shoes should not be worn outside
the clinic practice setting. When clinic clothing is worn outside, it

=== PAGE 452 ===
carries contamination from, and brings contamination into, the
treatment area. Another problem is that contamination is taken into the
home when uniforms are worn to and from the work area. When
laundered at home, the items from a dental office or clinic should be
kept separate and treated with household bleach for disinfection.

=== PAGE 453 ===

Use of Face Mask
In attempt to prevent airborne infections, it has been a common practice to
wear a mask when either the patient or the operator is known to have an acute
respiratory infection. Such a practice has its own value, but does not take into
account the fact that many diseases are transmissible during the incubation
period, when no clinical signs are apparent.
Dispersion of particles of debris, polishing agents, calculus and water, all
of which are contaminated by the patient’s oral flora, occurs regularly during
all instrumentation. The greatest aerosols are created following the use of a
handpiece, prophylaxis angle, or ultrasonic scaler. Evidence of the spread of
particles appears on the splashed face, glasses and uniform, and on the cover
placed over the patient for protection from the spray.
The shape, material, and degree of absorption will influence the
efficiency of a mask. A scientifically efficient mask will,
Prevent inward and outward passage of microorganisms.
Filter particles produced during dental and dental hygiene procedures.
Have minimal marginal leakage.
Various materials have been used for masks, including gauze and other
cloth, plastic foam, fibre glass, synthetic fibre mat, and paper. Glass fibre and
synthetic fibre mat were shown to be the most effective.

=== PAGE 454 ===
a.
b.
c.
Use of a Mask
Tie on the mask before a scrub or hand wash.
Use a fresh mask for each patient. When a mask becomes wet, it should
be changed, because a wet mask is not longer an effective barrier.
Keep the mask on after completing a procedure, while still in the
presence of aerosols. Particles under 5 micrometres remain suspended
longer (up to 24 hours) than larger particles and can be inhaled directly
into terminal lung alveoli. Removal of the mask in the treatment room
immediately following the use of aerosol-producing procedures,
permits direct exposure to airborne organisms.

=== PAGE 455 ===

b.
Use of Protective Eye Glasses
Dental team members
:
 Eye protection during dental and dental
hygiene appointments for the dental team members and patients is
necessary to prevent physical injuries and infections of the eyes.
Glasses should be worn at all times. For dental personnel who do not
require corrective lens for vision, protective glasses with clear lens
should become a routine parts of the clinical dress.
Patients
:
 Protective eye coverage is recommended for each patient at
each appointment. The patient’s medical history should reflect types of
eye surgery, implants, or other special concerns. Contact lens should be
removed.

=== PAGE 456 ===
Protective Glasses
Shielding on all sides of the glasses may give the best protection, provided
they fit closely around the edges.
Goggle-style coverage is specially necessary for protection during
laboratory work.
A side-shield can provide added protection. For the member of the dental
team, it may be possible to wear this type over regular prescription glasses.
When the sides of the glasses are curved back, they may provide adequate
protection, similar to those with side-shields.

=== PAGE 457 ===
•
•
•
•
Care of Protective Glasses
Run glasses under water stream to remove abrasive particles. Rubbing
an abrasive agent over the plastic lens will create scratches.
Immerse in 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde for disinfection.
Rinse thoroughly after immersion because glutaraldehyde is irritating
to eyes and skin.
Check periodically for scratches on the lens, and replace appropriately.

=== PAGE 458 ===
Hand Care
Hands, through direct contact with a patient’s saliva, become contaminated
and, therefore, are sources for cross-infection. Cross-infection can be at least
partially controlled by making a conscious effort to keep the gloved hands
from touching objects other than the instruments and disinfected parts of
equipment prepared for the immediate patient.

=== PAGE 459 ===

I. Bacteriology of the Skin
Resident bacteria
:
 Large numbers of relatively stable bacteria inhabit
the surface epithelium or deeper areas in the ducts of skin glands or
depths of hair follicles; they are ultimately shed with the exfoliated
surface cells, or with excretions of the skin glands. They may be
altered by newly introduced pathogens, or reduced by washing. They
tend to be less susceptible to destruction by the disinfection procedures.
Transient bacteria
:
 These reflect continuous contamination by routine
contacts: some bacteria are pathogens and may act temporarily as
residents, may be washed away, or in the event that a skin break exists,
may cause an autogenous infection. Most transients can be removed
with soap and water by washing for 5 to 10 minutes.

II. Handwashing Principles
1
Rationale
:
 Effective and frequent handwashing can reduce the overall
bacterial flora of the skin and prevent the organisms acquired from a
patient from becoming skin residents. It is impossible to sterilize the
skin, but every attempt must be made to reduce the bacterial flora to a
minimum.
Purposes
:
 The objective of all scrub procedures is to reduce the
bacterial flora of the hands to an absolute minimum.
An effective scrub procedure can be expected to accomplish the
following:
Remove surface dirt and transient bacteria.
Dissolve the normal greasy film on the skin.
Rinse and remove all loosened debris and microorganisms
With a long-acting antiseptic, provide disinfection.
Caring of the Hands
Maintain clean, smoothly trimmed, short finger nails with well-cared
cuticles to prevent breaks where microorganisms can enter.
Remove hand and wrist jewellery at the beginning of day.
Microorganisms can become lodged in revices of rings, watch bands
and watches where scrubing is impossible.
After handwashing, don gloves. Never expose open skin lesion or
abrasions to a patient’s oral tissues and fluids.
Keep gloved hands away from face, hair, clothing (pockets), dental
chain, operating stool (manipulate by foot action), telephone, patients
records and other objects, that cannot be sterilized or disinfected.

III. Facilities
1
Sink
Use a sink with a foot pedal for water flow control to avoid
contamination from faucet handles.
Adaptation for regular sink: Turn on water at the beginning and
leave on through the entire procedure. Turn faucets off with the
dowel after drying hands.
Use a sink of sufficient size so that contact with the inside of the
wash basin can be avoided easily. A sink cannot be sterilized
and is highly contaminated.
Prevent contamination of uniform by not leaning against the
sink.
Use a separate area and sink reserved for instruments washing,
contaminated instruments should be removed from the treatment
room prior to preparation for the next patient.
Soap
Use a liquid surgical scrub containing an antimicrobial agent.
Povidone-iodine (iodohore) has a broad-spectrum of action.
Chlorhexidine preparations are used extensively to provide rapid
disinfection and a cumulative persistent (residual) action.
Apply from a foot- or knee-activated dispenser to avoid
contamination to and from a hand-operated dispenser or cake
soap.
Do not substitute the use of foam hand preparation, alcohol
wipes, or other substitutes for handwashing, because many
pathogenic microorganisms cannot be destroyed by disinfecting
preparations. Rinsing is a very important part of handwashing
procedure.
Scrub brushes
Clean brushes with a detergent, and sterilize after each use.
Avoid over-vigorous use of a brush, to minimize skin abrasion.
Skin irritation and abrasion can leave openings for additional

cross-contamination.
Disposable sponges are available commercially and may be
preferred when a scrub brush is traumatic to the skin.
Identify brushes by label or colour code for handwashing to
prevent mixing with instruments scrub brushes; however, both
types will be sterilized. Handwashing and hand instruments
cleaning should be accomplished at separate sinks.
Towels
Obtain towel from a dispenser that requires no contact except
with the towel itself which hangs down from the container.
When a cloth towel is used, it must be used for only one patient.

IV. Methods of Handwashing
1
The three methods that will be described here are the short scrub, short
standard handwash, and the surgical scrub.
Handwashing techniques are usually defined by numbers of lathering and
rinsing, whereas scrub techniques are completed in time periods or by
specific numbers of scrub, brush strokes.
The two commonly used systems for scrub techniques are the “stroke-
count” method and the “time” method. In the stroke-count method, a specific
number of brush strokes is applied to each surface and each finger and part of
the hand is considered to have a 4 surfaces. In the time method, each surface
is scrubed for a certain number of seconds. When learning to perform a scrub,
it is helpful to combine the stroke-count and the time methods to assume
complete coverage and to develop a sequence of performance that can be
completed in the minimum of time.
A. Short Scrub
The short scrub is recommended for the beginning of the day just prior to the
first patient appointment and just prior to the first appointment of second half
of the day. It is also used following an appointment for a patient with known
communicable disease and following any major interruption that may have
caused unusual contamination.
When the time method is used, a short scrub may vary from a minimum
of 3–5 mins. Approximately, one-half of the time is used for scrubbing each
hand for 3 mins scrub, the time may be divided as follows:
Nails and finger tips—U min (15 sec each hand)
Finger and hands—1 U mins (45 secs each hand)
Wrist and forearm—1 min (30 secs each hand)
The procedure outlined below may be expected to take 3 mins when with
stroke-counts are applied to each surface.
Don eye glasses and masks and fire hair security back, remove watch
and all jewellery.
Wash hands and arms briefly, using surgical scrub soap. Leave water

running at a moderate speed, that will not allow splashing from base
and sides of the sinks.
Clean under finger nails with orange wood stick from sterile package.
Orange wood stick and scrub brush may be packaged together for
sterilization.
Rinse from finger tips to hands, wrists to elbows. Keep hands higher
than elbows through the entire procedure.
Lather hands and arms again. Leave the soap, lather on the hands and
arms during the scrub to increase exposure time to the antimicrobial
ingredient of the scrub soap.
Remove scrub brush from the previously opened sterile package; apply
several measures of soap. Note the time and start scrubing in an orderly
sequence without returning to the areas already scrubed.
First hand
Brush back with forth across nails and finger tips five times.
Begins with the thumb, use small circular strokes (five strokes
each area) on each side of thumb and each finger. Then palm
and back of hand, extend fingers to gain access to each crevice
and line.
Scrub wrist on all sides and move to forearm.
When completed rinse well, from finger tips on up the arm; let
water run off at the elbow.
Revise the brush with transfer to the other hand, repeat entire
procedure.
Rinse brush and drop it into the sink.
Rinse the hand and arm generously and thoroughly to wash away all
transient microorganisms.
Dry hand
Take care not to recontaminate hands while drying them.
Use a separate paper towel for each hand.
Cloth towel
:
 The one end of a large towel, for one hand and
other end for other hand, taking care not to drag the tower over
unwashed parts or clothing. Two small towels may be used, one

for each hand.
Don gloves.
B. Short Standard Handwash
Handwashing is done after the first glove removal and before and after each
succeeding glove application. It is the general procedure for all times except
those indicated under the short scrub technique.
Handwashing is considered the most important single procedure for the
prevention of contamination and is a basic requirement before and after
hospital patient care.
Don eye glasses and mask and fix hair securely. Remove watch and all
jewelleries.
Use comfortable warm water and surgical scrub soap.
Lather hands, wrist and forearms quickly, rubbing all surfaces
vigorously. Interface fingers and rub back and forth with pressure.
Rinse thoroughly, running the water from fingertips down the hands.
Repeat 2 more times. One lathering for 3 minutes is less effective than
3 short latherings and rinsing 3 times in 30 seconds. The lathering
serves to loosen, the debris and microorganisms and washes them
away.
Use paper towels for drying, taking care not to recontaminate.
C. Surgical Hand Scrub
Each hospital or oral surgery clinic will have rules with regulations for scrub
procedures.
A surgical scrub performed as the initial scrub a day should be 10 minutes
with subsequent scrubs may be 3–5 minutes. Following a contagious and
isolated patient, the scrub should be done for at least by 5 minutes.
The outline for a long scrub presented below is similar to the short scrub
described previously. The major differences are in the number of strokes,
when the stroke-count method is used and the longer time spent.
Don eye glasses, mask and hair coverings. Make sure hair is
completely covered. Remove watch and jewellery.

Open sterile brush package to have ready.
Wash hands, arms over the elbows, using surgical soap to remove gross
surface dirt before using the scrub brush. Lather vigorously with strong
rubbing motions, 10 on each side of hands, wrists, arms. Interlace the
fingers, thumbs to clean the proximal surfaces.
Rise thoroughly from fingertips across hands and wrists. Hold hands
higher than elbows throughout the procedure. Leave water running.
Use orange woodstick or file from the sterile package to clean nails.
Lather the hands, arms, leave the lather on during the scrub to increase
the exposure time to the antimicrobial ingredient.
Apply surgical soap, begin the brush procedure. Note the time and
scrub in an orderly sequence without returning to areas previously
scrubbed.
First hands and arms.
Brush back and forth across nails, finger tips, passing the brush
under the nails (30 seconds).
For fingers and hands use small circular strokes on all sides of
the thumb, each finger, overlapping strokes for complete
coverage (2 ½ minutes).
Continue to wrist. Apply more soap to maintain a good lather (2
minutes for wrist and forearm).
When arm is completed over the elbow, leave later on.
Repeat on other arm. Some systems require the use of a second sterile
brush for the second hand. When this is so, discard the first brush into
the proper container and obtain the second brush.
At one-half of the scrub time, rinse hands and arms thoroughly. First
one, then other starting at the fingertips, letting water pass over the
arm.
Lather and repeat to, but not over, the elbows.
At end of time (or counts), rinse thoroughly, each arm separately from
fingertips. When a sterile towel is available for drying apply towel
from fingertips to elbow without reapplying to hand area.
Hold hands up and clasp together. Proceed to dressing area for

V Gloves
3
The wearing of gloves is part of the total plan for control of cross-
contamination and protection of the clinician. Unseen blood from a patient
can be impacted, retained under the fingernails for five or more nails after
exposure during an appointment. Hepatitis virus is known to be resistant to
drying, might be retained under a fingernail with bloodsaliva. Even scrubbing
cannot remove all microorganisms from under nails.
Tiny cuts and abrasions cannot be seen or felt. Protective gloves are
needed at all times.
A. Type of Gloves
General use gloves
:
Material
: Latex vinyl non-sterile gloves are available. Latex
gloves may be of single or double thickness.
Surface
: Gloves are available as powdered or unpowdered.
Powdered gloves have either cornstarch or an antimicrobial
agent.
Sizes
: Ambidexterous gloves are made in small, medium, large
or extra-large in boxes of 100.
The general uses of gloves are commonly referred to as
‘examination’ gloves, but they are suitable for procedures that
do not require a strict sterile regimen. Wearing two pairs or
double gloving is useful in high-risk evaluations.
Sterile individually paired gloves
:
 Packaged and sealed in sterile pairs
by hand size. They are prepared for procedures requiring a sterile
technique. They have commonly been referred to as “surgeons gloves”
but they also have special case where high-risk patients are being
treated.
Utility gloves
:
 Non-used heavy utility gloves are indicated for all
instrument handling during clean up and preparation for sterilization,
as well as unit preparation, surface disinfection.
B. Procedures for Use of Gloves

=== PAGE 469 ===

Hand scrub before donning gloves
:
 Because gloves are susceptible to
tears, pinholes from instrument sticks, pricks can cause infection to be
introduced inadvertently. In addition, bacteria can multiply profusely
under gloves, where a warm damp medium is provided. Long finger
nails under gloves are a potential course of breaks in the gloves.
Torn, cut or punctured glove
:
 Remove immediately, wash hands
thoroughly and don new gloves.
Handwash before glove removal
:
 Before removing gloves, lather and
rinse thoroughly to:
Reduce possible contamination to hands during removal and
disposal.
Reduce contamination in the waste, particularly following a
patient known to have a communicable diseases.

Introduction to
Dental Public Health
Dental diseases have afflicted the human race since the earliest days.
Egyptian manuscripts refer to dental problems as early as 3700 BC.
Dentistry, however, existed as a vocation only in recent years and it was not
until modern times that the care of oral diseases developed any sort of
scientific basis.

Evolution of Dental Profession
1728
:
 A two-volume book published by Pierre Fauchard—Le Chirurgien
Dentiste, on Traite Desdents—remained an authoritative document in
dentistry for over 100 years. Pierre Fauchard is looked upon as a seminal
figure in the evolution of dental profession.
19
th
 century
:
 Aspiring dentist of the time served as apprentice. GV Black’s
formal training also did not exceed 20 months. His introduction to dentistry
with Dr Speers was not more than a few weeks whose dental library consisted
only of one book.

During the same time, The American Journal of Dental Science and The
First National Professional Organization were established.
20
th
 century
:
 Gies recommended that dental profession would progress only
when dental education became university based.
1930–1940
:
 The economic depression followed by World War II was a hard
time for dental education. The teaching in clinical sciences was emphasized
on restorative and prosthetic dentistry while radiology, diagnosis,
endodontics, periodontics were neglected.
1948
: National institute of dental research was established.
1957
: Post-war expansion was rapid and dentistry entered a new era with
technological growth. The arrival of high-speed engine revolutionized dental
practice.
1961
: The survey of dentistry was published which led to improvements in
education and practice.

=== PAGE 474 ===
1963
: Health Professions Educational Assistance Act was passed which
provided federal funds for construction and student aid. Semistagnant schools
were revitalized.
1960–1970
:
 This era saw an increasing interest in comprehensive care,
growth in the use of auxiliaries, prepaid dental insurance and the
development of a community outlook in dentistry. Growth in the number of
dentists and dental business was sharp.
1980s
: The down turn following the post Vietnam war saw a drop in
enrollment in dental schools. Five dental schools announced their closing.
1990s
:
 Dentistry is on the brink of new types of practice. The last 80 years
have seen dentistry’s growth, differentiation and maturation. Enormous
advances have been made in restorative and prosthetic techniques.
The demand for dental care will continue to rise, and the public attitudes
towards and expectation of dental care will take a dramatic changes in the
years to come.

=== PAGE 475 ===
Dental Public Health
Dentistry exists to serve the public. Dental public health is a relatively new
specialty subject, wherein the specialists have broad knowledge and skills in
public health administration, research methods, the prevention and control of
oral diseases, the provision and financing of oral health care and the study
and development of resources.

=== PAGE 476 ===
Definition (Winslow)
Dental public health is the science and art of preventing and controlling
dental diseases and promoting dental health through organized community
efforts. It is that form of dental practice which serves the community as a
patient rather than the individual. It is concerned with the dental education of
the public with applied dental research and with the administration of group
dental care programme as well as the prevention and control of dental
diseases on a community basis.

=== PAGE 477 ===
PERSONAL VERSUS COMMUNITY HEALTH
CARE
A student’s most common aim is to become a successful practitioner. Success
in practice is related to the number of people in the community who have
confidence in the dental practitioner’s abilities. That confidence is not limited
to technical dental services but over a broad-spectrum of community affairs
like advise on community proposals for health improvement.
2
Dental practitioners in solo practice need to know about public health, to
properly fulfill their community obligations. The partnership between public
and private resources is the only way that everyone’s dental needs can be
taken care of.

=== PAGE 478 ===
The Similarities
A. Examination/Survey
When patients first come to a dental office, the dental professional carries out
a careful examination. The examination ordinarily starts with a health and
personal history, and then goes on to a clinical assessment. An understanding
of the patient’s general health and personal background also forms a
necessary context for determining the dental treatment plan.
The first step in public health practice parallels that used by the clinician.
Only here, it is the community that must be examined. It is called a survey
instead of an examination and the parallel to the general health history taking
is a situation analysis. In dental public health, the word survey without
further clarification, usually means clinical assessments of the extent and
severity of disease in a population.
B. Diagnosis/Analysis
Following the examination of a patient, the next step is diagnosis. The same
approach is used in public health, where the diagnosis comes from analysis of
the survey data. A professional statistician may have to be employed to
process and analyze the survey data, but special purpose computer software
for both recording data in the field and analyzing it in the office are letting
dental public health practitioners become more self-reliant. Computers have
made survey analysis much less taxing and more efficient.
1
C. Treatment Planning/Programme Planning
Treatment planning is often complex because of the many factors that have to
be balanced. In addition to the dentist’s professional judgement of what is
required, there is the patient’s interest in his oral health, the cost of treatment,
the patients reluctance to undergo certain types of treatment. Alternative
methods of treatment need to be considered. Final outcome be it acceptance
or total rejection vary from patient to patient.
The public health professional like the clinician would like to have the
ideal program plan accepted with enthusiasm. The community’s reaction to
such a plan, may be to reject it or adopt it like the patient in the chair. It is the

=== PAGE 479 ===
community that makes the ultimate decision.
D. Treatment/Programme Operation
When a treatment plan has been accepted, the clinician arranges a schedule to
carry out the treatments.
Similarly when a specific community public health programme has been
adopted, a public health team with varied disciplines may be called on for
programme operation.
E. Payment/Programme Funding
Mutually agreed methods of payment for dental services are arranged
between the patient and dentist.
Programme funding is often a complicated mix of local, state and federal
funds, which the dental public health professional must first know how to
secure, and then to manage. Management may demand extensive reporting
requirements. Grant proposals for dental programmes, submitted to local
service clubs and local foundations, have proved successful in many cases.
F. Evaluation/Programme Appraisal
The dentist’s or hygienist’s evaluation of progress begins during the course of
treatment and is repeated at each visit. Observations made during the initial
examination, such as extent of plaque and calculus deposits, are evaluated
from time to time on recall. Evaluation can be objective only if careful
examination records of initial conditions were made and are available for
study and comparison with later observations.
Similarly, data collected in the initial survey serve as the base line against
which a programme appraisal can be made to assess the effectiveness of the
public health programme. Public health workers are accountable to the
community for a periodic appraisal of their performance just as dental
clinicians are accountable to their patients.

TRADITIONAL DENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH
PROGRAMMES
Special Population Groups
Traditionally, dental public health programmes have consisted of a number of
projects designed for special subgroups in the population. Certain groups,
because of their occupation, position or location, do not have access to
private practitioners and must be cared for in special clinics. Thus military
populations, inhabitants of Indian reservations, prisoners, institutionalized
people, veterans administration hospital patients, the handicapped, nursing
home residents, geriatric populations, and the indigent have traditionally
received care in clinics supported by public or private funds. The provision of
restorative and preventive care to many of these groups requires special
training and particular skills. The needs of these subgroups on the average are
significantly more severe than the average for the total population because of
lack of past treatment, often poor education, and neglect of oral hygiene
practices.
2
Dentists and auxiliaries, trained in the use of mobile dental equipment
and management of the disabled patient, are necessary in providing care
delivery to the homebound. Removal of the barrier to care and the improved
oral health result in an effective dental public health programme. Projects in
this category may include a caries bottle-mouth syndrome education
programme for young mothers, an oral cancer-screening programme for older
adults, a mouthguard fabrication programme for high school football players,
a denture-adequacy assessment programme for a geriatric population, a
fluoride-therapy programme for cancer patients undergoing head and neck
radiation, or implementation of a screening programme for the Head Start
children in the community.
2

=== PAGE 482 ===
Oral Cancer Screening Programme
Probably the programme in which most health professionals participate as a
public service is the oral cancer screening programme. Oral cancer is found
more frequently in persons over 50 years of age, in heavy smokers, or in
alcoholics. To begin the process of the programme planning, the first step is
to look at the population served to discern their need for an oral cancer-
screening programme.
Once the answers to these basic questions like,
What is the age makeup of the population? What are the mortality,
morbidity, incidence, and prevalence of oral cancer in this population?
Who will sponsor the program, and how will it be staffed and funded?
What existing resources are available?
Having determined these answers, communications with the target
population and with health professional peers should begin. It is important
that lay individuals should be interviewed to discern their knowledge of oral
cancer, as well as their receptivity to such a cancer screening programme.
Professional societies and organizations with the prime interest in the
programme should be consulted.
Arrangements need to be made for establishing the screening sites. Their
locations should be as convenient as possible for the adult population,
especially the geriatric groups. Neighbourhood health centres, family clinics
and nursing homes are ideal settings for such programmes. If possible, the
cancer screening should be arranged as part of a health fair, at which other
screening activities are simultaneously being conducted. Such scheduling
greatly increases participation.
Arrangements need to be made with appropriate private, public health, or
hospital-based histopathology laboratories for processing cytology smears or
biopsies arising from the programme. The programme should be funded
properly and supported. The short-range goal is to induce as many people as
possible to enter the programme, the longer term goal is to reduce the number
of deaths resulting from undetected oral cancer.
Once the screening phase is completed, it is then necessary to ensure that
all referred persons are sent for a definitive diagnosis and that confirmed

=== PAGE 483 ===
neoplastic lesions are treated.

=== PAGE 484 ===
Dental Health Education and Prevention
Dental health education and programmes have traditionally comprised a
significant portion of dental public health activities. Programmes devoted to
school children have been particularly popular because children have been
highly susceptible to dental caries. In addition, many children, especially
those with the highest disease levels whose families may not be able or
interested in providing for their oral health needs, do not visit dental offices.
Yet virtually all of them attend school and therefore would be exposed to a
school based programme. Enthusiasm for dental health education in many
school programmes needs tempering because it promotes unrealistic
expectations in caries control that are often not realized when programmes
are carefully evaluated. When expectations are not realized, disappointment
may be created as well as the attitude that all school based preventive
programmes are not successful.
Rather than eliminate school based preventive programs that some might
think are ineffective, it is important that they be maintained but that they
employ careful evaluation methods designed to determine the impact of the
programme on the oral health of the target population in terms of reduced
disease.

New Strategies
The principal dental diseases, caries and periodontal disease, are both
infectious but also chronic and deserve their share of attention towards their
prevention. Limited attention has been given in the past to public health
periodontal programmes. This has been partially due to the fact that the
majority of available resources have been allocated to caries control, for
several reasons:
Caries was considered a disease of children for whom a great amount
of sympathy existed; periodontal disease was considered a disease of
adults, who could take care of themselves.
It was easier to target survey and preventive programs for children in
conventional school settings than for adults scattered through out the
work place.
The current caries pattern in children indicates that the fissured tooth
surfaces experience the vast majority of caries attacks, while a decline has
occurred on the smooth surfaces. Pit and fissure sealants offer a highly
effective means to protect these vulnerable occlusal surfaces. Sealants can be
used in innovative ways in public health programmes. They can be used
effectively in conjunction with minimum restorations as well as over
incipient lesions where, complete sealing is ensured to avoid the loss of tooth
tissue. By using auxiliaries in their application wherever possible, allotted
funds could be spread over a large population. The preventive benefit
provided to a community by the initiation of flouridation or a changed
practice act that permits hygienists to apply sealants may be greater than the
benefit attained from a lifetime of practice by a dozen dentists. As caries
control measures are increasing in effectiveness, emphasis has shifted to
developing a nationwide periodontal disease control initiative.

=== PAGE 486 ===
Conclusion
Public health programs are usually identified with subsets of the population
other than the affluent. There is a great need for methods that will permit
better targeting of individuals at high risk to oral disease. Additional
emphasis is needed on periodontal disease detection and treatment programs.
Probably the two most cost-effective dental-preventive procedures are the
combined use of fluorides and pit-and-fissure sealants. Educational and
political methods should be used to ensure universal fluoridation, and greater
use of auxiliaries is necessary in the delivery of preventive dentistry health
services.

THE MOUTH MIRROR
I. Description
A. Parts
The mirror has three parts: The handle, shank and working end, which is the
mounted mirror or mirror head.
B. Mirror Surfaces
Plane (flat)
:
 May produce a double image.
Concave
:
 Magnifying.
Front surface
:
 The reflecting surface is on the front of the lens rather
than on the back as with plane or magnifying mirrors. The front surface
eliminates “ghost” images.
C. Diameters
Diameters vary from 5/8 to 1¼ inches. In addition, special examination
mirrors are available in 1½ to 2-inch diameters.
D. Attachments
Mirrors may be threaded plain stem or cone socket to be joined to a handle.
Because mirrors tend to become scratched, replacement of the working end is
possible without purchasing new handles.
E. Handles
Thicker handles contribute to a more comfortable grasp and greater
control.
Wider mirror handles are especially useful for mobility determination.
F. Disposable Mirrors
May be plastic in one piece or may be a handle with replaceable head
for professional use; may have front surface.

=== PAGE 490 ===
2.
Take-home mirrors for patient instruction. Patient may observe lingual
and posterior aspects. One type of mirror has a light attachment.

=== PAGE 491 ===
1.
2.
II. Purpose and Uses
The mouth mirror is used to provide:
A. Indirect Vision
This is particularly needed for distal surfaces of posterior teeth and lingual
surfaces of anterior teeth.
B. Indirect Illumination
Reflection of light from the dental overhead light to any area of the oral
cavity can be accomplished by adapting the mirror.
C. Transillumination
Reflection of light through the teeth.
Mirror is held to reflect light from the lingual aspect while facial
surfaces of the teeth are examined.
Mirror is held for indirect vision on the lingual while light from the
overhead dental light passes through the teeth. Translucency of enamel
can be seen clearly, whereas dental caries or calculus deposits appear
opaque.
D. Retraction
The mirror is used to protect or prevent interference by the cheeks, tongue, or
lips.

III. Procedure for Use
A. Grasp
Use modified pen grasp with finger rest on a tooth surface wherever possible
to provide stability and control.
B. Retraction
Use a water-based lubricant on dry or cracked lips and corners of
mouth.
Adjust the mirror position so that the angles of the mouth are protected
from undue pressure of the shank of the mirror.
Insert and remove mirror carefully to avoid hitting the teeth, because
this can be every disturbing to the patient.
C. Maintain Clear Vision
Warm mirror with water, rub along buccal mucosa to coat mirror with
thin transparent film of saliva, and request patient to breath through the
nose to prevent condensation of moisture on the mirror. Use a
detergent or other means for keeping a clear surface.
Discard scratched mirrors.

IV. Care of Mirrors
Dismantle mirror and handle for sterilization.
Examine carefully after ultrasonic cleaning or scrubbing with brush
prior to sterilization to assure removal of debris around back, shank,
and rim of reflecting surface.
Handle carefully during sterilization procedures to prevent other
instruments from scratching the reflecting surface.
Consult manufacturer’s specifications for sterilizing or disinfecting
procedures that may cloud the mirror, particularly the front surface
type.

INSTRUMENTS FOR APPLICATION OF AIR
3
I. Purposes and Uses
With appropriate, timely application of air to clear saliva and debris and/or
dry the tooth surfaces, the following can be accomplished:
A. Improve and Facilitate Examination Procedures
Make a thorough, more accurate examination.
Dry supragingival calculus to facilitate exploring and scaling. Small
deposits may be light in colour and not visible until they are dried.
Dried calculus appears chalky and presents a contrast to tooth colour.
Deflect the free gingival margin for observation into the area.
Subgingival calculus usually appears dark.
Make identification of areas of demineralization and carious lesions
easier.
Recognize location and condition of restorations, particularly tooth-
colour restorations.
B. Improve Visibility of the Treatment Area During
Instrumentation
Dry area for finger rest to provide stability during instrumentation.
Facilitate positive scaling techniques.
Minimize appointment time.
Evaluate complete removal of supragingival calculus after
instrumentations.
C. Prepare Teeth and/or Gingiva for Certain Procedures
Examples are to dry surfaces for:
Application of caries-preventive agents.
Make impression for study cast.
Apply topical anaesthetic.

II. Compressed Air Syringe
A. Description
Air source
: Air compressor with tubing attachment to syringe.
Air tip
: Has angled working end that can be turned for maxillary or
mandibular application. Tip may be disposable or removable for
sterilization.
B. Procedure for Use
Use palm grasp about the handle of the syringe; place thumb on release
lever or on button on handle.
Test the air flow so that the strength of flow can be controlled.
Make controlled relatively short, gentle applications of air.
Supplement air drying with use of saliva ejector and folded gauze
sponge placed in vestibule.
C. Precautions
Avoid sharp blasts of air on sensitive cervical areas of teeth or open
carious lesions such areas may be dried by blotting with a gauze
sponge or cotton roll to avoid causing discomfort.
Avoid applying air directly into a pocket. Subgingival plaque may be
forced into the tissues and bacteraemia created.
Avoid forceful application of air, which can direct saliva and debris out
of the oral cavity which contaminate the working area and the clinician,
and create aerosols. Air directed toward the posterior region of the
patient’s mouth may cause coughing.
Avoid startling the patient; forewarn when air is to be applied.

PROBE
4
Early in patient examination, the patient’s periodontal disease status must be
determined. Treatment planning varies depending on whether the condition is
gingivitis, which may be reversible, or periodontitis with periodontal pockets;
bone loss, and root surface involvement, which may require more extensive
therapy (
Fig. 11.1
).
Fig. 11.1:
 Examples of probes
Two general types of probes available are the traditional or standard
manual probes and the controlled force or automated probes. Automated
probes were developed and researched in an attempt to overcome the
problems in obtaining consistent readings with traditional probes.
Factors that influence probe determinations are variations in pressure
(probing force) used, diameter, and other physical features, and the
inconsistent depth or penetration during application.
A probe is used to make the initial assessment, followed by a detailed
evaluation to determine the extent and degree of severity of disease and tissue
destruction for specific treatment planning. During treatment, the probe is
applied to assess progress.
After treatment, use of the probe helps to determine completion of
professional services as recognized by the health status of the tissues. At each
maintenance appointment, a re-evaluation with the probe is needed to ensure
continued self-care by the patient and to identify early disease changes that
require additional professional treatment.

I. Purposes and Uses
A probe is used to:
A. Assess the Periodontal Status for Preparation of a
Treatment Plan
Classify the disease as gingivitis or periodontitis by determining
whether bone loss has occurred and whether the pockets are gingival or
periodontal. A systematic screening method can be used.
Determine the extent of inflammation in conjunction with the overall
gingival examination. Bleeding on probing is an early sign of
inflammation in the gingiva.
B. Make a Sulcus and Pocket Survey
Examine the shape, topography, and dimensions of sulci and pockets.
Measure and record probing depths.
Evaluate tooth-surface pocket wall.
Chart calculus location and severity.
Record other root surface irregularities discerned by the probe.
Determine clinical attachment level.
C. Make a Mucogingival Examination
Determine relationship of gingival margin, attachment level, and
mucogingival junction.
Measure the width of the attached gingiva.
D. Make Other Gingival Determinations
Evaluate gingival bleeding on probing and prepare a gingival bleeding
index.
Measure the extent of visible gingival recession.
Determine the consistency of the gingival tissue.

=== PAGE 498 ===
1.
2.
3.
E. Guide Treatment
Determine gingival characteristics, including probing depth, bleeding,
and consistency (all determined using a probe), to provide a basis for
patient instruction as part of the total treatment.
Define probing depth of sulcus or pocket for application of instruments
for scaling and root planning, and define depth for use of an explorer
for evaluation of these procedures.
Detect anatomic configuration of roots, subgingival deposits, and root
irregularities.

II. Description
A probe is a slender instrument with a smooth, rounded tip designed for
examination of the depth and topography of an area. It has three parts: The
handle, the angled shank, and the working end, which is the probe itself.
A. Materials
Stainless steel.
Plastic, for screenings and titanium implant probing.
B. Characteristics
Straight working end:
Tapered, round, flat, or rectangular in cross-section with a
smooth rounded end.
Calibrated in millimetres at intervals specific for each kind of
probe some have colour coding.
Curved working end
:
 Paired furcation probes have a smooth, rounded
end for investigation of the topography and anatomy around roots in a
furca. Examples are the Nabers 1N and 2N probes.
C. Selection
The probe chosen for use by a clinician is frequently the instrument first used
when a particular technique was learned, or one that provides comfort and
ease of manipulation.
Another reason for selection is that consistency in reading can be
accomplished.
Analysis of a probe and comparison with other probes are recommended.
Important features to be considered in probe selection are
1. 
Adaptability
:
 The probe should be adaptable around the complete
circumference of each tooth, both posterior and anterior, so that no millimeter
of probing depth can be neglected. Flat probes require more attention to
adaptation and are useful primarily on facial and lingual surfaces.
2. 
Markings
:
 Markings should be easy to read so that probing depth can

=== PAGE 501 ===
be readily identified and measured, and no disease area is over looked.
Colour coding contributes to read ability.

=== PAGE 502 ===
GUIDE TO PROBING

A pocket is a diseased gingival sulcus. The use of a probe is the only
accurate, dependable method to locate, assess, and measure sulci and pockets.

I. Pocket Characteristics
A pocket is measured from the base of the pocket (top of attached
periodontal tissue) to the gingival margin.
The pocket (or sulcus) is continuous around the entire tooth, and the
entire pocket or sulcus must be measured. “Spot” probing is
inadequate.
The depth varies around an individual tooth; probing depth rarely
measures the same all around a tooth or even around one side of a tooth
(
Fig. 11.2
).
Fig. 11.2:
 Probing depth
The level of attached tissue assumes a varying position around
the tooth.
The gingival margin varies in its position on the tooth.
Proximal surfaces must be approached by entering from both the facial
and lingual aspects of the tooth (
Fig. 11.3
).

Fig. 11.3:
 Proximal surface probing
Gingival and periodontal infections begin in the col area more
frequently than in other areas
Probing depth may be deepest directly under the contact area
because of crater formation in the alveolar bone
Anatomic features of the tooth-surface wall of the pocket influence the
direction of probing. Examples are concave surfaces, anomalies, shape
of cervical third, and position of furcations.

=== PAGE 505 ===
II. Evaluation of Tooth Surface
During the movement of the probe, calculus and tooth surface irregularities
can be felt and evaluated. The information obtained is used to plan the
scaling and root planing appointments.

III. Factors that Affect Probe Determinations
2
The general objectives of probing are, accuracy and consistency so that
recordings are dependable for comparison with future probings as well as
with colleagues in practice together. At the same time, patient discomfort and
trauma to the tissues must be minimal. Probing is influenced by many factors,
such as those that follow:
A. Severity and Extent of Periodontal Disease
With application of a light pressure, the probe passes along the tooth surface
to the attached tissue level. Diseased tissue offers less resistance so that with
increased severity of inflammation, the probe inserts to a deeper level
1
.
Average levels show that the probe is stopped as follows:
Normal healthy tissue
:
 The probe is at the base of the sulcus or
crevice, at the coronal end of the junctional epithelium.
Gingivitis and early periodontitis
:
 The probe is within the junctional
epithelium.
Advanced periodontitis
:
 Probe tip penetrate through the junctional
epithelium to reach attached connective tissue fibers.
B. The Probe Itself
Calibration
: Must be accurately marked.
Thickness
: A thinner probe slips through narrow pocket more readily.
Readability
: Aided by the markings and colour coding.
C. Technique
Grasp
: Appropriate for maximum tactile sensitivity.
Finger rest placed on non-mobile tooth with uniformity.
D. Placement Problems
Anatomic variations
: Tooth contours, furcations, contact areas,
anomalies.
Interferences
: Calculus, irregular margins of restorations, fixed dental

=== PAGE 507 ===
3.
prostheses.
Accessibility and visibility
: Obstructed by tissue bleeding, limited
opening by patient, macroglossia.
E. Application of Pressure
Consistent pressure is accomplished by consistent grasp and finger rest in
addition to keen tactile sensitivity.

PROBING PROCEDURES
1
I. Probe Insertion
Grasp the probe with modified pen grasp.
Establish finger rest on a neighboring tooth, preferably in the same
dental arch.
Hold the side of instrument tip flat against the tooth near the gingival
margin. The cervical third of a primary tooth is more convex.
Gently slide the tip under the gingival margin.
Healthy or firm fibrotic tissue
: Insertion is more difficult
because of the close adaptation of the tissue to the tooth surface;
underlying gingival fibres are strong and tight.
Spongy, soft tissue
: Gingival margin is loose and flabby because
of the destruction of underlying gingival fibers. Probe inserts
readily, and bleeding can be expected on gentle probing (
Fig.
11.4
).

2.
II. Advance Probe to Base of Pocket
Hold side of probe tip flat against the tooth surface
: Widespread roots
of primary molars may make this probe position difficult unless the
tissue is unduly distended by the probe.
Slide the probe along the tooth surface vertically down to the base of
the sulcus or pocket.
Maintain contact of the side of the tip of the probe with the
tooth.
Gingival pocket
: Side of probe is on enamel.
Periodontal pocket
: Side of probe is on the cemental or
dentinal surface when inserted to a level below the
cemento-enamel junction.
As the probe is passed down the side of the tooth, roughness
may be felt. Evaluation of the topography and nature of the tooth
surface is important to instrumentation.
When obstruction by hard bulky calculus deposit is encountered,
lift the probe awayfrom tooth and follow over the edge of the
calculus until the probe can move vertically into the pocket
again.
The base of the sulcus or pocket feels soft and elastic (compared
with the hard tooth surface and calculus deposits), and with
slight pressure, the tension of the attached periodontal tissue at
the base of the pocket can be felt.
Use only the pressure needed to detect by tactile means the level of the
attached tissue, whether junctional epithelium or deep connective tissue
fibers. A light pressure of 10 g, or of no more than 20 g, is ample.
Position probe for reading
:
Bring the probe to position as nearly parallel with the long axis
of the tooth as possible for reading the depth.
Interference of the contact area does not permit placing the
probe parallel for the measurement directly beneath the contact
area. Hold the side of shank of the probe against the contact to
minimize the angle.

=== PAGE 510 ===

III. Read the Probe
 (
Fig. 11.5
)
Measurement for a probing depth is made from the gingival margin to
the attached periodontal tissue.
Count the millimetres that show on the probe above the gingival
margin and subtract the number from the total number of millimetres
marked on the particular probe being used.
When the gingival margin appears at a level between probe marks, use
the higher mark for the final reading.
Dry the area being probed to improve visibility for specific reading.

 Comparison of probe reading

IV. Circumferential Probing
A. Probe Stroke
Maintain the probe in the sulcus or pocket of each tooth as the probe is
moved in a walking stroke (
Fig. 11.6
).
It is not necessary to remove the probe and reinsert it to make
individual readings. Time would be wasted.
Repeated withdrawal and reinsertion cause unnecessary trauma to the
gingival margin and hence increase post-treatment discomfort.
B. Walking Stroke
 (
Fig. 11.6
)
Hold the side of the tip against the tooth at the base of the pocket.
Slide the probe up (coronally) about 1 to 2 mm and back to the
attachment in a “touch... touch... touch...” rhythm.
Observe probe measurement at the gingival margin at each touch.
Advance millimetre by millimetre along the facial and lingual surfaces
into the proximal areas.

V. Adaptation of Probe for Individual Teeth
A. Molars and Premolars
Orient the probe at the distal line angle for both facial and lingual
application.
Insert probe at the distal line angle and probe in a distal direction; adapt
the probe around the line angle; probe across the distal surface until the
side of the probe contacts the contact area, then slant the probe to
continue under the contact area.
Note the probing depth and slide the probe back to the distal line angle.
Proceed in the mesial direction around the mesial line angle and across
the mesial surface.
B. Anterior Teeth
Initial insertion may be at the distal line angle or from the midline of
the facial or lingual surfaces.
Proceed around the distal line angle and across the distal surface;
reinsert and probe the other half of the tooth.
C. Proximal Surfaces
Continue the walking stroke around each line angle and on to the
proximal surface.
Roll the instrument handle between the fingers to keep the side of the
probe tip adapted to the tooth surface at line angles and as the tooth
contour varies.
Continue the strokes under the contact area. Overlap strokes from

Make sure that the col area under each contact has been thoroughly
examined.

Clinical Attachment Level
5
Attachment level refers to the position of the periodontal attached tissues at
the base of a sulcus or pocket. It is measured from a fixed point to the
attachment, whereas the probing depth is measured from a changeable point
(the crest of the free gingiva) to the attachment (
Fig. 11.7
).
Fig. 11.7:
 Clinical attachment level
I. Rationale
A loss of attachment occurs in disease as the junctional epithelium migrates
toward the apex. Stability of attachment is characteristic in health, and
treatment procedures may be aimed to obtain a gain of attachment.
Evaluation can be made of the outcome of periodontal treatment and the
stability of the attachment during maintenance examinations. When
periodontal disease is active, pocket formation and migration of the
attachment along the cemental surface continue.
II. Procedure
A. Selecting a fixed point
Cementoenamel junction is usually used.
Margin of a permanent restoration.
For animal research, a notch may be made in the tooth; in human

research studies, a template or splint may be made for each patient.
B. Measuring in the presence of visible recession
Cementoenamel junction is visible directly.
Measure from the cementoenamel junction to the attachment.
The clinical attachment level is greater than the probing depth when
there is visible recession.
C. Measuring when the cementoenamel junction is covered by gingiva
Slide the probe along the tooth surface, into the pocket, until the
cementoenamel junction is felt.
Remove the calculus when it covers the cementoenamel junction.
Measure from the gingival crest to the cementoenamel junction.
Subtract the millimeters from cemento enamel junction to gingival
crest from the total probing depth to the attachment.
Probing depth is greater than the clinical attachment level when the
cementoenamel junction is covered by free gingiva.
D. Measuring when the free gingival margin is level with the
cementoenamel junction
Apply the probe as has been described.
The probing depth equals the clinical attachment level when the free
gingival margin is level with the cementoenamel junction.

EXPLORERS
 (
Fig. 11.8
)
I. General Purposes and Uses
3
An explorer is used to:
Detect by tactile sense, the texture and character of the tooth surface.
Examine the supragingival tooth surfaces for calculus, demineralized
and carious lesions, defects or irregularities in the surfaces and margins
of restorations, and other irregularities that are not apparent to direct
observation. An explorer is used to confirm direct observation.
Examine the subgingival tooth surfaces for calculus, demineralized and
carious lesions, diseased altered cementum, and other cemental
changes that can result from periodontal pocket formation.
Define the extent of instrumentation needed and guide techniques for
Scaling and root planing
Finishing a restoration
Removing an overhanging filling.
Evaluate the completeness of treatment as shown by the smooth tooth
surface or the smooth restoration.
Identify pits and fissures appropriate for sealant application.

II. Description
The basic parts of an instrument are:
A. Working End
Slender, wirelike, metal tip that is circular in cross section and tapers to
a fine sharp point.
Design
:
Single. A single instrument may be universal and adaptable to
any tooth surface, or it may be designed for specific groups of
surfaces.
Paired. Paired instruments are mirror images of each other,
curved to provide access to contralateral tooth surfaces.
Design of a balanced instrument (
Fig. 11.9
). Middle of working
end should be centered over the long axis of the handle.
Fig. 11.9:
 Balanced explorer design
B. Shank
Straight, curved, or angulated
. Whether a shank is straight, curved, or

=== PAGE 517 ===
2.
1.
2.
1.
2.
angulated depends on the use and adaptation for which the explorer
was designed. A curved shank may facilitate application of the
instrument to proximal surfaces, particularly of posterior teeth.
Flexibility
:
 The slender, wire-like explorers have a degree of flexibility
that contributes to increased sensitivity.
C. Handle
Weight
: For increased acute tactile sensitivity, a lightweight handle is
more effective.
Diameter
: A wider diameter with serrations for friction while grasping
can prevent finger cramping from too tight a grasp. With a lighter
grasp, tactile sensitivity can be increased.
D. Construction
Single-ended
: A single-ended instrument has one working end on a
separate handle.
Double-ended
:
 A double-ended instrument has two working ends, one
on each end of a common handle. Most paired instruments are
available double-ended. Other double-ended instruments combine two
single instruments, for example, two unpaired explorers or an explorer
with a probe.

=== PAGE 518 ===

III. Preparation of Explorers
Sharpen and retaper a dull explorer tip. With the explorer tip sharp and
tapered, the following can be expected:
Increased tactile sensitivity with less pressure required.
Prevention of unnecessary trauma to the gingival tissue, because less
pressure allows greater control.
Decreased instrumentation time with increased patient comfort.

IV. Specific Explorers and their Uses
A variety of explorers are available as shown by the examples. The function
of each type is related to its adaptability to specific surfaces of teeth at
particular angulations. Certain explorers can be used effectively for detection
of dental caries in pits and fissures, and others are designed to be adapted to
examine proximal surfaces for calculus or dental caries. By other criteria,
some can be used subgingivally, whereas others cannot be adapted
subgingivally without inflicting damage to the sulcular epithelium. Therefore,
such explorers are limited to supragingival adaptation only.
A. Subgingival Explorer
Names and numbers
: Urban no. 20. TU.17. pocket explorer.
Shape
: The pocket explorer has an angulated shank with a short tip.
The tip should be measured to assure that it is less than 2 mm. A longer
tip cannot be adapted to the line angles of narrow roots.
Features for subgingival root examination:
Back of tip can be applied directly to the attached periodontal
tissue at the base of the pocket without lacerating. When a
straight or sickle explorer is directed towards the base of the
pocket, the sharp tip can pass into the epithelium without
resistance.
The short tip can be adapted to rounded tooth surfaces and line
angles. Long tips of other explorers have a tangential
relationship with the tooth and cause distention and trauma to
sulcular or pocket epithelium.
Narrow short tip can be adapted atthe base where the pocket
narrows without undue displacement of the pocket soft tissue
wall.
Supragingival use of no. TU-17
: It may be adapted to all surfaces and
is especially useful for proximal surface examination. It is not readily
adaptable to pits and fissures.

a.
b.
Use
: Examining pits and fissures and supragingival smooth surfaces;
examining surgeons and margins of restorations and sealants.
Adaptability
:
Difficult to apply to proximal surfaces because the wide hook
can contact an adjacent tooth and the straight long section the tip
can pass over a small proximal carious lesion.
Not adaptable for deep subgingival exploration. When the point
is directed to the base of a pocket, trauma to the attachment area
can result. In the attempt to prevent such damage, the clinician
may not explore to the base of pocket, thus providing
incomplete service.
C. Pigtail or Cowhorn
Use
: Proximal surfaces for calculus, dental caries, or margins of
restorations.
Adaptability
:
 As paired, curved tips, they are applied to opposite tooth
surfaces.
D. Straight
Use
: Supragingival, for pits and fissures, tooth irregularities of smooth
surfaces, and surfaces and margins of restorations and sealants.
Adaptating
:
For pit and fissure caries, the explorer tip is held parallel with
the long axis of tooth and applied straight into a pit.
Not adaptable deep in subgingival area. Straight shanked
instruments or those with long tips cannot be adapted reading in
the apical portion of the pocket near the attached tissue or on
line angles.

=== PAGE 521 ===
BASIC PROCEDURES FOR USE OF EXPLORERS
3
Development of ability to use an explorer and a probe is achieved first by
learning the anatomic features of each tooth surface and the types of
irregularities that may be encountered on the surfaces. The second step is
repeated practice of careful and deliberate techniques for application of the
instruments.
The objective is to adapt the instruments in a routine manner that relays
consistent comparative information about the nature of the tooth surface.
Concentration, patience, attention to detail, and alertness to each irregularity,
however, small it may seen, are necessary.

=== PAGE 522 ===
I. Use of Sensory Stimuli
Both explorers and probes can transmit tactile stimuli from tooth surfaces to
the fingers. A fine explorer usually gives a more acute sense of tactile
discrimination to small irregularities than does a thicker explorer. Probes vary
in diameter; the narrow types may provide greater sensitivity.

=== PAGE 523 ===
1.
2.

3.
1.
2.
II. Tooth Surface Irregularities
Three basic tactile sensations must be distinguished when probing or
exploring. These may be grouped as normal tooth surface, irregularities
created by excess or elevations in the surface, and irregularities caused by
depressions in the tooth surface. Examples of these are listed here.
A. Normal
Tooth structure
: The smooth surface of enamel and root surface that
has been planed, anatomic configurations, such as cingula, furcations.
Restored surfaces
: Smooth surfaces of metal (gold, amalgam) and the
softer feeling of plastic; smooth margin of a restoration.
B. Irregularities: Increases or Elevations in Tooth
Surface
Deposits calculus.
Anomalies
: Enamel pearl; unusually pronounced cementoenamel
junction.
Restorations
: Overcontoured, irregular margins (overhang).
C. Irregularities: Depressions, Grooves
Tooth surface
: Demineralized or carious lesion, abrasion, erosion, pits
such as those caused by enamel hypoplasia, areas of Cemental
resorption on the root surface.
Restorations
: Deficient margin, rough surface.

=== PAGE 524 ===
III. Types of Stimuli
During exploring and probing, distinction of irregularities can be made
through auditory and tactile means.
A. Tactile
Tactile sensations pass through the instrument to the fingers and hand and to
the brain for registration and action. Tactile sensations, for example, may be
the result of catching on an over contoured restoration, dropping into a
carious lesion, hooking the edge of a restoration or lesion, encountering an
elevated deposit, or simply passing over a rough surface.
B. Auditory
As an explorer or probe moves over the surface of enamel, cementum, a
metallic restoration, a plastic restoration, or any irregularity of tooth structure
or restoration, a particular surface texture is apparent. With each contact,
sound may be created. The clean smooth enamel is quiet; the rough
cementum or calculus is scratchy or noisy. Sometimes a metallic restoration
may squeak or have a metallic ring. With experience, differentiations can be
made.

=== PAGE 525 ===
SUPRAGINGIVAL PROCEDURES
5
I. Use of Vision
Supragingival exploration for defects of the tooth surface differs from
subgingival in that, when a surface is dried, much of the actual exploration is
performed to confirm visual observation. The exceptions are the proximal
areas near and around contact areas that cannot be directly observed.
Unnecessary exploration should be avoided. With adequate light and a
source of air, proper retraction, and use of mouth mirror, dried supragingival
calculus can generally be seen as either chalky-white or brownish-yellow in
contrast to tooth colour. A minimum of exploration can confirm the finding.

=== PAGE 526 ===
a.
b.
c.
II. Facial and Lingual Surfaces
Adapt the side of tip with the point always on the tooth surface.
Move the instrument in short walking strokes over the surface being
examined, or direct the tip gently into a suspected carious lesion.
Avoid deliberate exploration of cervical third areas where there is
recession or where the patient has previously exhibited sensitivity. If a
sensitive area must be dried, avoid an air blast, and blot with a gauze
sponge or a cotton roll.

=== PAGE 527 ===
a.
b.
III. Proximal Surfaces
Lead with the tip on to a proximal surface, rolling the handle between
the fingers to as sure adaptation around the line angle. Keep the side of
the point of the explorer in contact with the tooth surface at all times.
Explore under the proximal contact area when there is recession of the
papilla and the area is exposed. Overlap strokes from facial and lingual
surfaces to ensure full coverage.

II. Steps
With the tip in contact with the tooth supragingivally, hold the lower
shank (the part of the shank that is next to the tip) parallel with the long
axis of the tooth. Gently slide the tip under the gingival margin into the
sulcus or pocket.
Keep the point in contact with the tooth at all times to prevent
unnecessary trauma to the pocket or sulcular epithelium. Adapt the tip
closely to the tooth surface by applying the side of the point.
Slide the explorer tip over the tooth surface to the base of the pocket
until, with the back of the tip, the resistance of the soft tissue of the
attached periodontal tissue is felt. Calculus deposits may obstruct direct
passage of the instrument to the base of the pocket. Lift the tip slightly
away from the tooth surface and follow over the deposit to proceed to
the base of the pocket.
Use a “walking” stroke, vertical or diagonal (oblique).
Lead with the tip. Move it ahead as the strument progresses.
Length of stroke depends on the depth of a pocket.
Shallow pocket
:
 The stroke may extend the entire depth,
from the base of pocket to just beneath the gingival
margin.
Deep pocket
:
 Controlled strokes 2 to 3 mm long can
provide more acute sensitivity to the surface and allow
improve adaptation of the instrument. A deep pocket
should be explored in sections. One should first explore
the apical area next to the base of the pocket, then move
up to a higher section, overlaping for full coverage.
Do not remove the explorer from the pocket for each stroke on a
particular surface because
Trauma to the gingival margin caused by repeated
withdrawal and reinsertion can cause the patient post-
treatment discomfort.
Concentration on the texture of the tooth surface is
interrupted.

=== PAGE 530 ===

More time is consumed
Proximal surface:
Lead with tip of instrument; do not “back into” an area.
Continue the strokes around the line angle. Roll the instrument
handle between the fingers to keep the tip closely adapted as the
tooth contour changes.
Continue strokes under the contact area. Overlap strokes from
facial and lingual aspects for full coverage.

=== PAGE 531 ===
RECORD FINDINGS
I. Supragingival Calculus
A. Distribution
Supragingival calculus is generally localized. It is most commonly confined
to the lingual surfaces of the mandibular anterior teeth and the facial surfaces
of the maxillary first and second molars, opposite the openings to the salivary
ducts.
B. Amount
Slight, moderate, heavy.

=== PAGE 532 ===
II. Subgingival Calculus
A. Distribution
Subgingival calculus can be either localized or generalized.
B. Amount
Slight, moderate, heavy.

III. Other Irregularities of Tooth Surface
Note on the chart or in the record any other deviation from normal detected
while using the explorer.

RADIOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN PERIODONTAL
INFECTIONS
I. Bone Level
A. Normal Bone Level
 (
Fig. 11.11
)
The crest of the interdental bone appears from 1.0 to 1.5 mm from the
cementoenamel junction.
Fig. 11.11:
 Normal bone level
B. Bone Level in Periodontal Disease
The height of the bone is lowered progressively as the inflammation is
extended and bone is resorbed.

=== PAGE 535 ===
1.
2.
II. Shape of Remaining Bone
A. Horizontal
When the crest of the bone is parallel with a line between the
cementoenamel junctions of two adjacent teeth, the term “horizontal
bone loss” is used (
Figs 11.12
 and 
11.13
).
Fig. 11.12:
 Horizontal bone loss
Fig. 11.13:
 Horizontal bone loss—second molar has drifted mesially
When inflammation is the sole destructive factor, the one loss usually
appears horizontal.

=== PAGE 536 ===
3.
4.
1.
2.
3.
When the amount of remaining bone is fairly evenly distributed
throughout the dentition, the condition is described as generalized
horizontal bone loss. It may be designated either by millimeters from
the position of the normal bone level or by percentage. When making
estimates, referral to the table of average root lengths can be helpful.
When bone loss is confined to specific areas. The condition is
described as localized horizontal bone loss.
B. Angular or Vertical
 (
Fig. 11.14
)
Reduction in height of crestal bone that is irregular; the bone level is
not parallel with a line joining the adjacent cementoenamel junctions;
bone loss is greater on the proximal surface of one tooth than on the
adjacent tooth.
Angular bone loss is more commonly localized; rarely generalized.
When inflammation and trauma from occlusion are combined in
causing the destruction and irregular shape of the bone, the bone may
appear with “angular defects” or with “vertical bone loss.”
Fig. 11.14:
 Angular or vertical bone loss; mesial of the first molar

=== PAGE 537 ===
III. Crestal Lamina Dura
A. Normal
White, radio-opaque; continuous with and connects the lamina dura of the
roots of two adjacent teeth; covers the interdental bone
B. Evidence of Disease
The crestal lamina dura is indistinct, irregular, radiolucent, fuzzy.

=== PAGE 538 ===
1.
2.
3.
4.
IV. Furcation Involvement
2
A. Normal
Bone fills the area between the roots.
B. Evidence of Disease
Radiolucent area in the furcation.
Early furcation involvement may appear as a small radiolucent black
dot or as a slight thickening of the periodontal ligament space. It can be
confirmed by probing. Early furcation involvement is shown in the
second molar.
Furcation involvement of maxillary molars may become advanced
before radiographic evidence can be seen. Superimposition of the
palatal root may mask a small area of involvement. When the proximal
bone level in the radiograph appears at the level where, the furcation is
normally located, furcation involvement should be suspected and
probed for confirmation.
Maxillary first premolar furcation involvement cannot be seen in a
radiograph except at an unusual angulation or unusual position of the
tooth. With correct vertical and horizontal angulation, the roots are
superimposed.
Furcations may show at one angulation but not at another; variations in
technique can obscure a furcation involvement. All furcations must be
carefully probed.

=== PAGE 539 ===
1.
2.
V Periodontal Ligament Space
1
A. Normal
The periodontal ligament is a connective tissue and, hence, appears
radiolucent in a radiograph. It appears as a fine black radiolucent line next to
the root surface. On its outer side is the lamina dura, the bone that lines the
tooth socket and appears radio-opaque.
B. Evidence of Disease
Widening or thickening
Angular thickening or triangulation. The space is widened only near
the coronal third, near the crest of the interdental bone.
Complete periodontal ligament thickened along an entire side of a root
to the apex, or around the root. When viewed at different angulations
(in the various radiographs of a complete survey), the ligament space
may reveal varying thicknesses, thus showing that the disease
involvement is not consistent around the entire root or that other
structures are superimposed.

=== PAGE 540 ===
EARLY PERIODONTAL DISEASE
1
The real preventive service is to recognize early signs of periodontal
involvement so that treatment can be initiated to arrest the disease and
prevent more severe involvement, which could lead to tooth loss recognition
of severe bone loss, advanced furcation involvement, and marked thickening
of the periodontal ligament space (
Fig. 11.15
) is not difficult after a basic
understanding has been gained. The difficult part is to watch carefully for
incipient, often isolated indications of early periodontal disease. These
changes can be seen in all age groups, from young children to elderly
patients.
Fig. 11.15:
 Periodontal ligament space

=== PAGE 541 ===
I. Earliest Signs
The earliest signs of periodontal involvement are not evident in a radiograph.
Only after the inflammation has extended from the soft tissue (gingivitis) to
the supporting periodontal tissues and bone resorption has come sufficient
does radiographic evidence appear.

=== PAGE 542 ===
a.
b.
II. Initial Bone Destruction
The usual interproximal pathway of information from gingivitis to
periodontitis is directly from the inflamed gingival connective tissue
into the crest of the interdental bone
Initial bone destruction most frequently occurs at the crest of the
interdental bone in the crestal lamina dura.

=== PAGE 543 ===
a.
b.
III. Radiographic Evidence
Crestal lamina dura may appear slightly regular, fuzzy, and
radiolucent. At this stage, it is best examined with a hand magnifying
glass.
Angular thickening of the periodontal ligament space (triangulation)
may also be apparent.

=== PAGE 544 ===
OTHER RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS
Any other radiographic findings that may be related directly or indirectly to
periodontal involvement and its contributing factors should be noted in the
record. Certain findings have a direct relation to dental hygiene care and
instruction, particularly local factor that contribute to food impaction or
plaque retention.

=== PAGE 545 ===
I. Calculus
Gross deposits, primarily those on proximal surfaces, may be seen in
radiographs. Observing these may be helpful, but the probe and explorer are
needed to define the exact location and extent.
The density and contrast of the radiograph influence whether or not
calculus is seen. Because all deposits are not visible, the use of radiographs
has very limited value for specific calculus detection.

=== PAGE 546 ===
II. Overhanging Restorations
Some proximal overhanging margins may be seen in radiographs. The use of
an explorer is necessary to detect irregular margins and to examine all
proximal margins that do not reveal irregularities in the radiographs.
Superimposition can mask an overhanging margin.

=== PAGE 547 ===
a.
b.
c.
III. Dental Caries
Certain findings should be noted for their relationship to the periodontal
tissues.
Large carious lesions may leave open contact areas that permit food
impaction and hence damage to the periodontal tissues.
Carious lesions, either enamel or root caries, hold plaque and provide a
rough surface for retention of food debris and bacterial plaque.
Root caries and demineralization may interfere with techniques of root
planning and require instruction in remineralization procedures.

=== PAGE 548 ===

IV. Relationship to Pockets
Radiographs do not show pockets; soft tissue does not show in a
radiographbecause a pocket is measured from the gingival margin to the base
of the pocket, both of which are soft tissue, pockets cannot be seen in a
radiograph. Probing is necessary to identify pockets.
Use topical anaesthetic to help to alleviate discomfort while probing.
Avoid the most common errors in probing:
Not passing the probe to the full pocket depth.
Not measuring around the entire tooth and therefore missing
pockets. This error most commonly applies to proximal surface
probing. The probe must be passed more than halfway across
from the facial aspect to overlap with the probe used on the
lingual aspect, which should also be passed more than halfway
across.
Check the markings on a new probe by measuring on a standard
millimeter ruler.
When bleeding is readily elicited on probing or exploring and tooth
surfaces are obscured so that examination is complicated, initiate
toothbrushing and other appropriate disease control methods. Explain
the problem to the patient, and outline a specific home care routine
designed to reduce gingival inflammation. Postpone the complete
examination for 1 week, after which the gingival condition should be
improved.
Replace mirror heads frequently. Scratched mirrors obscure vision and
delay procedures.
Handle explorers and probes carefully. Because the tips are pliable and
relatively fragile, precautions must be taken against breakage or
bending.

FACTORS TO TEACH THE PATIENT
The need for a careful, thorough examination if treatment is to be
complete and effective.
Information about the instruments and how their use makes the
examination complete. Examples are the complete radiographic survey,
probing 360° around each tooth, and exploring each subgingival tooth
surface.
Why bleeding can occur when probing. Healthy tissue does not bleed.
Relation of probing depth measurements to normal sulci.
Significance of mobility.

Indices for Oral Diseases
An index is an expression of clinical observations in numerical values. It is
used to describe the status of the individual or group with respect to a
condition being measured. Indices have been developed to compare the
extent and severity of disease.

=== PAGE 552 ===
Definition
An index has been defined by Russell AL as “a numerical value describing
the relative status of a population on a graduated scale with definite upper
and lower limits, which is designed to permit and facilitate comparison with
other populations classified by the same criteria and methods”.

Ideal Requisites
Clarity, simplicity, objectivity
:
 The index should be simple and easy to
carry out.
Validity
:
 The index must measure what it is intended to measure, so it
should correspond with clinical stages of the disease under study.
Reliability
:
 The index should measure consistently at different times
and under a variety of conditions.
Quantifiability
:
 The index should be amenable to statistical analysis so
that the status can be expressed by a number.
Sensitivity
:
 The index should be able to detect small shifts in either
direction.
Acceptability
:
 The index should not be painful or demeaning to the
subject.

Purposes and Uses of an Index
A distinction must be made between an individual oral health assessment
score, a clinical trial and a community health epidemiological survey.
I. Individual Clinical Score
Purpose
In clinical practice, an index, plaque record, or scoring system for an
individual patient can be used for education, motivation, and evaluation.
Uses
Provides individual assessment to help a patient recognize an oral
problem.
Reveals the degree of effectiveness of present oral hygiene practices.
Motivates the person in preventing and obtaining professional care for
the elimination and control of oral disease.
Evaluates the success of individual and professional treatment over a
period of time by comparing index scores.
II. Clinical Trial
Purpose
A clinical trial is planned for the determination of the effect of an agent or
procedure on the progression, control, or prevention of disease. The trial is
conducted by comparing an experimental group with a control group that is
similar to the experimental group in every way except for the variable being
studied.
Uses
Determines baseline data before experimental factors are introduced.
Measures the effectiveness of specific agents for the prevention,
control, or treatment of oral conditions.
Measures the effectiveness of mechanical devices for personal care,
such as toothbrushes, interdental cleaning devices or water irrigators.

III. Epidemiologic Survey
Purpose
An epidemiologic survey is to study the disease characteristics of
populations. It has been used with populations around the world to study the
extent of diseases.
Uses
Shows the prevalence and incidence of a particular condition occurring
within a given population.
Provides baseline data to show existing dental health practices.
Assesses the needs of a community.
Compares the effects of a community programmes and evaluates the
results.
Descriptive Categories
1. General categories
Simple index
: One that measures the presence or absence of a
condition. For example, index that measures the presence of bacterial
plaque without evaluating its effect on the gingiva.
Cumulative index
:
 One that measures all the evidence of a condition,
past and present, e.g. DMF Index for dental caries.
2. Types of simple and cumulative indices
Irreversible
: One that measures conditions that will not change, e.g.
DMF Index.
Reversible
: One that measures conditions that can be changed, e.g.
plaque index.
Composite index
: Combination of reversible and irreversible aspect of
disease, e.g. Russell periodontal index. Concerned with the clinical
sign of active gingival inflammation (gingival indices) and the
destructiveness of the condition by pocket deepening and bone
resorption.

Selection criteria
A useful and effective index will:
Be simple to use and calculate.
Require minimal equipment and expense.
Require minimal amount of time to complete.

=== PAGE 560 ===
Purpose
To assess the thickness of plaque at the gingival area.

=== PAGE 561 ===
Selection of Teeth
The entire dentition or selected teeth can be evaluated.
Areas examined
Four gingival areas (distal, facial, mesial, lingual) are examined
systematically for each tooth.

=== PAGE 562 ===
0 =
1 =
2 =
3 =
Procedure
Dry the teeth and examine visually using adequate light, mouth mirror, and
probe or explorer. Evaluate bacterial plaque on the cervical third; pay no
attention to plaque that has extended to the middle or incisal thirds. Probe to
test the surface when no plaque is visible. Pass the probe or explorer across
the tooth surface in the cervical third and near the entrance to the sulcus.
When no plaque adheres to the probe tip, the area is scored 0. When plaque
adheres, a score of 1 is assigned.
Use a disclosing agent, if necessary, to assist evaluation for the 0 to 1
scores. When the Plaque index is used in conjunction with the gingival index
(GI) the GI must be completed first because the disclosing agent masks the
gingival characteristics.
Include plaque on the surface of the calculus and on dental restorations in
the cervical third in the evaluation.
Criteria
No plaque
A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area
of the tooth. The plaque may be recognized only after application of
disclosing agent or by running the explorer across the tooth surface.
Moderate accumulation of the soft deposits within the gingival pocket
that can be seen with the naked eye or on the tooth and gingival
margin.
Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or the tooth
and gingival margin.

Scoring
PlI for area
: Each area (distal, facial, mesial, lingual, or palatal,) is
assigned a score from 0 to 3.
PlI for a tooth
: Scores for each area are totaled and divided by 4.
PlI for groups of teeth

PATIENT HYGIENE PERFORMANCE (PHP) INDEX
This index was proposed by Podshadley AG and Haley JV in 1968.
2

=== PAGE 565 ===
Purpose
To assess the extent of plaque and debris over a tooth surface. Debris is
defined for the PHP index as the foreign material consisting of bacterial
plaque, materia alba, and food debris that is loosely attached to tooth
surfaces.

Selection of Teeth and Surfaces
Teeth examined
:
 16, 11, 26, 36, 31, 46.
Substitutions
:
 When the first molar is missing, or less than three-
fourths erupted, has a full crown, or is broken down, the second molar
is used. The third molar is used when the second is missing. Provided it
is functional the adjacent central incisor is used for a missing incisor.
Surfaces
:
 The facial surfaces of incisors and maxillary molars and the
lingual surfaces of mandibular molars are examined. These surfaces are
the same as those used for the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index.

=== PAGE 567 ===
1.
2.
Procedure
Apply disclosing agent. Instruct the patient to swish for 30 seconds and
expectorate but not to rinse.
Examination is made using a mouth mirror.
Each tooth surface to be evaluated is subdivided into 5 sections as follows
(
Figs 12.1
 and 
12.2
).
Fig. 12.1:
 Divisions for the PHP for the upper anterior teeth
Fig. 12.2:
 Divisions for the PHP for the lower anterior teeth
Vertically
: Three divisions—mesial, middle, distal.
Horizontally
: The middle third is subdivided into gingival, middle, and
occlusal or incisal thirds.
Each of the subdivisions is scored for the presence of stained debris as
follows:

Basic Definitions
Biofilm
:
 A biofilm is a complex aggregation of microorganisms
growing on a solid substrate. Biofilms are characterized by structural
heterogenecity, genetic diversity, complex community interactions, and
an extracellular matrix of polymeric sub-stances.
Plaque
:
 Dental plaque can be defined as the soft deposits that form the
biofilm adhering to the tooth surface or other hard surfaces in the oral
cavity, including removable and fixed restorations. It is of two types
(
Table 12.3
):
Supragingival plaque—it is found at or above the gingival
margin.
Subgingival plaque—it is found below the gingival margin,
between the tooth and the gingival sulcular tissue.

Materia alba
:
 It refers to the soft accumulations of bacteria and tissue
cells that lack the organized structure of dental plaque and are easily
displaced with a water spray.
Calculus
:
 It is a hard deposit that forms by mineralization of dental
plaque and is generally covered by a layer of unmineralized plaque. It
is of two types (
Table 12.4
):
Supragingival calculus
—denotes deposits, usually white to
yellowish-brown in colour. Present occlusal to the free gingival
margin.
Subgingival calculus
—denotes deposits apical to the free
gingival margin. These deposits usually are light brown to black
in colour. A no. 5 explorer is used to estimate surface area
covered by supragingival calculus and to probe for subgingival

ORAL HYGIENE INDEX (OHI)
Proposed by John C Greene and Jack R Vermillion in I960.
3

=== PAGE 574 ===
a.
b.
c.
d.
Purpose
To measure existing debris and calculus as an indication of oral cleanliness.
Components
:
 The OHI has two components, the Debris Index and the
Calculus Index. The two scores when added give the OHI score.
Selection
:
 Only fully erupted permanent teeth. (A tooth is considered
fully erupted when it has reached the occlusal plane.)
Exclusion
:
 Third molars are excluded, teeth with full crown
restorations, and teeth reduced in height—severe dental caries or
trauma.
Method of examination
:
 The side of the number 23 explorer to be
moved from the incisal to cervical end. Use an explorer to supplement
visual examination for supragingival calculus deposits. Identify
subgingival deposits by gently placing a dental explorer into the distal
gingival crevice and drawing it subgingivally from the distal contact
area to the mesial contact area. The maxium score per sextant to be
examined on the buccal and lingual aspect for each segment (

Calculation for an Individual
Each selected surface has a severity score of 0 to 3.
The total score for debris or calculus ranges from 0 to 36.
The OHI score ranges from 0 to 12.
There is no interpretation of the OHI as good, fair or poor. The score is

written as it and is compared against the score of other individuals only. This
is the limitation of the OHI.
Advantages
Sensitive to reflect the cleansing efficiency of the toothbrushing and
the relationships between oral cleanliness and periodontal disease.
Simple, useful method for assessing a group of individual oral hygiene
status quantitatively.
Useful tool in evaluation and monitoring oral hygiene maintenance
programmes.
Can assess individual’s attitude and effectiveness of tooth brushing in
oral hygiene practices.
Limitations
Examination of all surfaces of all teeth present in the mouth (though
only 12 surfaces are scored). More time consuming.
Since it is time consuming, it cannot be used in epidemiological
surveys.
Intra- and interexaminer errors are more.

4

=== PAGE 578 ===
1.
2.
3.
Purpose
To assess oral cleanliness by estimating the tooth surface covered with debris
or calculus.
A. Components
The OHI-S has two components, the Simplified Debris Index and the
Simplified Calculus Index. The two scores may be used separately or may be
combined for the OHI-S.
B. Comparison with OHI
After experience with the Oral Hygiene Index, the need for simplification
was recognized because of the length of the time required to evaluate debris
and calculus, as well as to make subjective decisions on tooth selection.
Tooth selection
:
 In the OHI, the examiner has to select the tooth with
the most debris or calculus in each sextant. The OHI-S assess 6 specific
teeth, 1 in each sextant.
Number of surfaces
:
 In the OHI, 12 surfaces are evaluated; only 6
surfaces are used in the OHI-S.
Scoring
:
 The OHI ranges from 0 to 12; the OHI-S ranges from 0 to 6.

=== PAGE 579 ===
1.
2.
Selection of Teeth and Surfaces
A. Identify the 6 Specific Teeth
Posterior
:
 The first fully erupted tooth distal to each second premolar
is examined. The facial surface of the maxillary molars and the lingual
surfaces of the mandibular molars are used. Although usually the first
molars, the second or third molars may be used.
Anterior
:
 The facial surfaces of the maxillary right and the mandibular
left central incisors are used. When either is missing, the opposite
central incisor is scored.
B. Extent
A score represents half the circumference of the selected tooth; includes
proximal surfaces to the contact areas.

Definition of calculus
: Dental calculus is a hard deposit of
inorganic salts composed primarily of calcium carbonate and
phosphate mixed with debris, microorganisms, and desquamated
epithelial cells.
Examination
: Use an explorer to supplement visual examination
for supragingival calculus deposits. Identify subgingival
deposits by gently placing a dental explorer into the distal
gingival crevice and drawing it subgingivally from the distal
contact area to the mesial contact area.

PERIODONTAL INDICES
Periodontal disease is a term, which includes all pathological conditions of
the periodontium, e.g. gingival and the supporting structure that is cementum,
periodontal ligament and alveolar bone).
The signs of periodontal pathologic alteration involve:
Colour change in soft tissues
Swelling
Bleeding
Pockets
Mobility
Epidemiologic studies dealing with periodontal disease frequently do not
differentiate between gingivitis and the more destructive forms of disease.
Most of the indices used in periodontal diseases are based on the
gingivitis—periodontitis continuum.
The choice of the periodontal index should relate to the type and
objective of the study.

=== PAGE 597 ===
PERIODONTAL INDEX (PI)
Introduced by Russell AL in the year 1956.
7
Periodontal index is a composite index because it records both the
reversible changes due to gingivitis and the more destructive and presumably
irreversible changes brought by deeper periodontal disease.

=== PAGE 598 ===
1. Purpose
To assess and score the periodontal disease status of populations.

=== PAGE 599 ===
2. Method
All the teeth are examined.
All of the tissue circumscribing a tooth is considered a scoring or gingival
unit and is assessed for gingival inflammation and periodontal involvement
(
Table 12.9
).
Table 12.9:
 
Recording form for Russell’s Periodontal Index


=== PAGE 600 ===
3. Instruments Used
Each tooth is examined using a mouth mirror and explorer with adequate
illumination. (In the original examination, a Jacquette scaler and chip blower
were used to define the presence of periodontal pockets.) At present, a
periodontal probe is used.

=== PAGE 601 ===
4. Scoring Criteria
 
Table 12.8
.
Table 12.8:
 
Scoring criteria—periodontal index
‘0’ Negative
There is neither overt
inflammation in the
investing tissues nor
loss of function caused
by destruction of
supporting tissues.
Radiographic
appearance is normal
‘1’ Mild gingivitis
There is an overt area of
inflammation in the free
gingiva that does not
circumscribe the tooth.
 
‘2’ Gingivitis
Inflammation
completely
circumscribes the tooth
(but there is no apparent
break in epithelial
attachment).
 
‘4’
 
There is early notch like
resorption of alveolar
crest.
‘6’ Gingivitis with
pocket formation
The epithelial
attachment has been
broken and there is a
pocket not merely a
deepened gingival
crevice caused by
swelling in the free
gingiva. There is no
interference with normal
masticatory function,
the tooth is firm in its
socket and has not
drifted.
There is horizontal bone
loss involving the entire
alveolar crest, up to half
of the length of the
tooth root.

=== PAGE 602 ===
‘8’ Advanced
destruction with loss of
masticatory function
The tooth may be loose,
may have drifted, may
sound dull on
percussion with a
metallic instrument,
may be depressible in its
socket.
There is advanced bone
loss involving more
than one-half of the
length of tooth root, or a
definite infrabony
pocket with widening of
periodontal ligament.
There may be root
resorption or rarefaction
at apex.
 
Rule
: When in doubt assign lesser score.

Why breakdown of scores?
Initially bone loss was recorded by radiographs. Grading can be given in a
sequence if radiographs are taken. Clinical signs and symptoms are taken
from 0–8. It is difficult to differentiate clinically from one stage to another
and hence let to the breakdown of scores.

PERIODONTAL DISEASE INDEX (PDI)
Introduced by Ramfjord SP in 1967.
8
The PDI is a clinician’s modification of Russell’s Periodontal Index for
epidemiological surveys of periodontal disease. The PDI combines the
evaluation of gingival status with the probed attachment level. Although not
part of PDI, a calculus index and plaque index have usually been included
when making a survey (
Table 12.10
).
Table 12.10:
 
Recording form Ramfjord’s periodontal disease index

=== PAGE 606 ===


=== PAGE 607 ===
1. Purpose
To assess the prevalence and severity of gingivitis and periodontitis and to
show the periodontal status of an individual or a group.

2. Selection of Teeth
For short-term clinical trials and where a limited number of patients are
available, one may concern all of the teeth in the mouth but otherwise.
Six teeth are used to represent the six segments of the dentition, i.e.
Only fully erupted teeth is scored.
Substitutions are not made for missing teeth.

A. Determine Gingival Status
Under standardized light, dry the gingiva with cotton to observe colour
and form.
Apply gentle pressure with the probe to determine consistency. When
the colour change definitely indicates the presence of inflammation, the
consistency is not checked.
Scoring criteria
Absence of signs of inflammation.
Mild to moderate inflammatory gingival changes, not extending around
the tooth.
Mild to moderately severe gingivitis extending all around the tooth.
Severe gingivitis characterized by marked redness, swelling, tendency
to bleed and ulceration, not necessarily extending around the tooth.
Calculation
Individual
B. Determine Crevice Depth from CEJ
Instrument used
: To obtain consistent readings, a probe is needed. Here a
Michigan probe no. 0 is used.
Location of measurements
Two measurements
: When two measurements are made, they are at the
middle of the facial surface and at the facial aspect of the mesial
contact area with the side of the probe held touching both teeth.
Four measurements
:
 Originally, four measurements were used, i.e.
facial, lingual, distal and mesial. It was later found that no significant
loss in accuracy resulted from using only 2 measurements.

Procedure
Locate the CEJ with probe tip and measure the distance from gingival
margin.
When calculus interferes, scaling is performed.
Apply probe to measure the pocket depth from gingival margin to
attached periodontal tissue and subtract the distance to the CEJ.
When there is apparent recession, the direct reading from the CEJ can
be measured.
Scoring criteria
is gingival index.
A score is given when the pocket of any 2 or 4 recorded areas extend
apically to the CEJ not more than 3 mm but including 3 mm.
When the pocket depth of any of the 2 or 4 recorded areas extend
apically to the CEJ from 3 to 6 mm inclusive.
When the pocket depth of any of the 2 or 4 recorded areas extend
apically more than 6 mm from the CEJ.

THE COMMUNITY PERIODONTAL INDEX OF
TREATMENT NEEDS (CPITN)
In 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) appointed an expert
committee to review the current methods available to assess periodontal
status and treatment needs.
A Joint International Dental Federation (FDI) and World Health
Organization (WHO) working group was established in 1979 to develop and
test a survey method for assessing periodontal conditions suggested in a
WHO technical report (WHO, 1978).
Following extensive discussions and testing, the CPITN was finalized and
described in 1982 by Jukka Ainamo, David Barmes, George Beagrie, Terry
Cutress, Jean Martin and Jennifer Sardo-Infirri.
9
 Over the past few years, the
CPITN has been increasingly adopted as a procedure for classifying
periodontal conditions with respect to the complexity of care and oral health
personnel required to restore periodontal tissues to a healthy condition. Some
profiles of the periodontal conditions of populations are becoming evident
from completed surveys. The Community Periodontal Index of Treatment
Needs (CPITN) is a quick system which provides the information most
necessary by simple examination procedure.
2
It was initially used as a screening procedure for epidemiological
purposes, later the index has been adopted for other purposes like in
promoting periodontal health awareness programmes for initial screening and
for monitoring changes in periodontal needs of individuals in clinical
practice. It is a procedure which uses clinical parameters and criteria relevant
to planning for the prevention and control of periodontal diseases. It records
the common treatable conditions, viz. gingival inflammation (identified by
bleeding on gentle probing), periodontal pockets, dental calculus and other
plaque retentive factors. It is designed as an indicator of treatment need.
This index provides a rapid and reproducible method of assessing the
periodontal condition of the patient at the first visit.

=== PAGE 613 ===
The World Health Organization Probe
The recommended periodontal probe for use with CPITN was first described
in the WHO 621 technical report (WHO, 1978) and reported in detail by
Emslie (1980). This type of tactile probing or sensing instrument is
considered to be an extension of the examiner’s fingers. The CPITN probe
(
Figs 12.5
 and 
12.6
) is designed for gentle manipulation of the sensitive soft
tissues around the teeth. The WHO probe has two special characteristics.
Firstly, it has a ball ended tip of 0.5 mm in diameter. Secondly, the
graduations are a band of 2 mm which is colour-coded on the shaft beginning
3.5 mm from the tip. A further modification of probe incorporates two further
graduations at 8.5 mm and 11.5 mm. The rationale for ball-ended probe is a
twofold: Firstly, detection of subgingival calculus is made easier, secondly,
there is less likely that an excessive pressure be used to cause penetration of
the tissue. The recommended probing force is between 15 and 25 grams.
Fig. 12.5:
 CPITN—E probe

=== PAGE 614 ===
Fig. 12.6:
 CPITN—C probe
The first colour-coded band allows the operator to assess whether the
probing depth is less than 3.5 mm, between 3.5 and 5.5 mm or in excess of
5.5 mm. These divisions divide periodontal pockets by depth, which helps in
identifying different types of treatment needs.

=== PAGE 615 ===
Probing Procedure
A tooth is probed to determine pocket depth, to detect calculus and bleeding
response.
Probing force is divided into: (i) a working component to determine
pocket depth; and (ii) sensing component to determine the subgingival
calculus and overhanging restorations. Use of standard force in probing is not
more than 25 gm, since this amount of force is resisted by healthy epithelial
attachment and it is sufficient to elicit bleeding from the area of
inflammation.
When inserting the probe, into periodontal pocket, the ball point should
follow the anatomic configuration of the root surface for sensing subgingival
calculus. The probe is inserted between the tooth and the gingiva and the
sulcus depth or pocket depth is sensed and read against the colour code or
measuring lines. The direction of the probe should be in the same plane as the
long axis of the tooth. The ball end should be kept in contact with the root
surface. Pain to the patient during probing is an indication of a heavy sensing
force.
A practical test for establishing the working force of not more than 25 gm
is to gently insert the probe under the finger nail without causing pain or
discomfort.

Recording Data
A box chart is recommended as the epidemiological and dual office chart for
recording CPITN data.

Assessing the Index
The index is used to detect the presence or absence of:
Bleeding on probing
Calculus or overhanging restorations
Periodontal pockets
In compiling this index, the teeth and their associated periodontal units
are divided into six parts (sextants) and each sextant is given a score. All the
surfaces of each standing tooth are examined and only the worst periodontal
unit in each sextant is recorded. The six sextants are defined by tooth
numbers—17–14, 13–23, 24–27, 37–34, 33–43, 44–47 (FDI nomenclature).
The sextant is examined only if there are two or more teeth present and not
indicated for extraction. When only one tooth remains in a sextant, it is
included in the adjacent sextant.

=== PAGE 618 ===
Index Teeth
In epidemiological survey for adults aged 20 years and more, ten index teeth
are examined. These teeth have been identified as the best estimators (WHO,
1984; Sivaneswaran, 1985) of the worst periodontal condition of the mouth.
The ten specified index teeth are:
17–16 11
26–27
47–46 31
36–37
The molars are examined in pairs and the highest score is recorded. Only
one score is recorded from each sextant. For young people below 20 years,
only six index teeth, 16, 11, 26, 36, 31, 46 are examined. The second molars
are excluded because of high frequency of false pockets (non-inflammatory
changes associated with tooth eruption). For screening and monitoring
purposes, in adults over 19 years and above, highest score of any tooth in the
sextant is recorded ignoring the lower scores.
In examination of children less than 15 years, pockets are not recorded
although probing for bleeding and calculus is carried out in the same
procedure.

=== PAGE 619 ===
Examination Procedure
The main aim is to determine the highest score for each sextant with minimal
number of measurements. The requirement is that more than one functional
tooth should be present. The tip of the CPITN probe is gently inserted
between tooth and gingiva to the full depth of the sulcus or pocket and the
probing depth is read by observation of the position of the black band.
Recommended sites for probing are mesial, midline and distal on both facial
and lingual/palatal surfaces.
The probing may be done by withdrawing the probe between each
probing or alternatively with the probe tip remaining in the sulcus, the probe
is ‘walked’ around the tooth.

=== PAGE 620 ===
Codes and Criteria
 (Table 12.11)
The appropriate code for each sextant is determined with respect to the
following criteria.
Code 4
:
Pathological pocket of 6 mm or more.
The coloured band of the CPITN probe is not visible.
If the designated tooth/teeth are found to have 6 mm or deep
pockets in the sextant examined, and code 4 is given to the
sextant, there is no need to record the presence or absence of
pathological pockets of 4 or 5 mm, calculus or bleeding.
Code 3
:
Pathological pocket of 4 to 5 mm that is, only a part of the
coloured band is visible.
If the deepest pocket is between 4 and 5 mm found in a
designated tooth/teeth and code 3 is given, there is no need for
recording calculus or bleeding.
Code 2
:
The whole of the coloured band of the probe is visible but
supragingival or subgingival calculus or other plaque retentive
factors such as ill fitting crowns or defective margin of a filling
are either seen or felt during probing.
If no pockets which involve or exceed the coloured area of the
CPITN probe, but supra- or subgingival calculus or other plaque
retentive factors are detected, and code 2 is given, it is not
necessary to examine for gingival bleeding.
Code 1
:
Bleeding present.
Code 0
:
Healthy tissues.
Code X
:
When only one tooth or no teeth are present in a sextant (third
molars are excluded unless they function in a place of second
molars).

=== PAGE 621 ===
Treatment Needs
CPITN assess only those conditions potentially responsive to treatment. It
does not analyse non-treatable or irreversible conditions like recession,
attachment level. The term ‘treatment need’ is intended as a guide to the level
of need for care using accepted periodontal criteria. It provides as indication
of the nature of treatment needed to improve periodontal health. This can be
used for a community, as a comprehensive programme of periodontal disease
control and preventive measures.

=== PAGE 622 ===
Classification of Treatment Needs
The population groups or individuals are divided into appropriate treatment
need (TN) category depending upon the severity of periodontal disease.
TN-0
:
No treatment
When there is a recording of code 0 (health) or X (missing) for
all six sextants.
TN-1
:
Improvement of personal oral hygiene.
When there is a recording of a code of 1 or higher.
TN-2
:
Professional scaling and removal of plaque retentive factors and
oral hygiene instruction.
When there is a recording of a code of 2 or higher.
TN-3
:
Complex treatment which can involve deep scaling, root planing
and complex procedures.
When there is a recording of code 4.
The advantages of CPITN are that it is a simple and rapid recording
system with international uniformity. Its limitations are partial recording,
exclusion of important signs of past periodontal disease, e.g. attachment loss
and it does not record any marker of disease activity. However, CPITN
procedure provides an overview of the magnitude of periodontal health of the
population.

=== PAGE 623 ===
MOBILITY INDEX
It was given by Miller PD in the year 1985.
10
All teeth have a slight degree of physiologic mobility, which varies for
different teeth and at different times of the day. Single-rooted teeth have
more mobility than multi-rooted teeth, with incisors having the most.
3

=== PAGE 624 ===
Tooth Examined
All the teeth are examined.

=== PAGE 625 ===
Procedure
The tooth is held firmly between the handles of two metallic instruments or
with one metallic instrument and one finger and an effort is made to move it
in all directions, abnormal mobility most often occurs faciolingually.

=== PAGE 626 ===
Scoring Criteria
Class I
:
 The tooth can be moved less than 1 mm in a buccolingual direction.
Class II
:
 The tooth can be moved 1 mm or more in a buccolingual direction,
but does not exhibit abnormal mobility in an occlusoapical direction.
Class III
:
 The tooth can be moved bucco-lingually and occlusoapically.

DECAYED-MISSING-FILLED INDEX (DMF INDEX)
The Decayed-Missing-Filled Index was introduced by Henry T Klein,
Carrole. E Palmer and Knutson JW in 1938.
11
DMF index is the most universally employed index for measuring dental
caries.
This index is based on the fact that the dental hard tissues are not self-
healing, established caries leaves a scar of some sort. The tooth either
remains decayed, or if treated it is extracted or it is filled. The DMFT index
is, therefore, an irreversible index, meaning that it measures total lifetime
caries experience.

All the 28 permanent teeth are examined. The teeth not included are:
The third molars.
Unerupted teeth.
Congenitally missing and supernumerary teeth.
Teeth removed for reasons other than dental caries such as for
orthodontic treatment or impaction.
Teeth restored for reasons other than dental caries such as trauma,
cosmetic purposes or for use as a bridge abutment.
Primary tooth retained with the permanent successor erupted. The
permanent tooth is evaluated since a primary tooth is never included in
this index.

Principles and Rules in Recording DMFT
 (
Table 12.12
)
No tooth must be counted more than once. It is either decayed, missing,
filled or sound.
Decayed, missing and filled teeth should be recorded separately since
the components of DMFT are of great interest.
When counting the number of decayed teeth, also include those teeth
which have restorations with recurrent decay.
Care must be taken to list as missing only those teeth which have been
lost due to decay. Also included should be those teeth which are so
badly decayed that they are indicated for extraction. The following
should not be counted as missing.
Unerupted teeth.
Missing teeth due to accident.
Congenitally missing teeth.
Teeth that have been extracted for orthodontic reasons.
A tooth may have several restorations but it is counted as one tooth.
Deciduous teeth are not included in DMFT count.
A tooth is considered to be erupted when the occlusal surface or incisal
edge is totally exposed or can be exposed by gently reflecting the
overlying gingival tissue with the mirror or explorer.

Examination Method for DMFT
 (Permanent Teeth Only)
‘D’
—
Decayed
:
 Indicates the number of permanent teeth that are decayed. In
counting the number of decayed permanent teeth, remember that a tooth can
only be counted once. It cannot be counted as decayed and filled. If it has
been restored and caries can be described, count it as decayed. Be sure the
explorer falls into carious tooth substance and not just in a deep groove
before counting occlusal caries.
‘M’
—
Missing
:
 Indicates the number of missing permanent teeth due to
decay. Those teeth which are so badly decayed that they are indicated for
extraction are counted as missing. Possible histories should be taken when it
is suspected that teeth have been lost for reasons other than caries.
‘F’
—
Filled
:
 Indicates the numbers of permanent teeth that have been
attacked by caries, due to which have been restored to keep them in a healthy
condition in mouth. A tooth may have several fillings but it is counted as one
tooth.

Calculation of the Index
Individual DMFT
:
 Total each component, i.e. D, M and F separately,
then total D + M + F = DMFT
Group average
:
 Total the D, M and F for each individual. Then divide
the total ‘DMF’ by the number of individuals in the group. For
example,

Limitations of DMFT Index
DMFT values are not related to the number of teeth at risk.
DMFT index can be invalid in older adults because teeth can become
lost for reasons other than caries.
DMFT index can be misleading in children whose teeth have been lost
due to orthodontic reasons.
DMFT index can overestimate caries experience in teeth in which
preventive fillings have been placed.
DMFT index is of little use in studies of root caries.
For an individual, the individual component of the DMFT carry meaning.
Whereas in a larger population, the cumulative value of dental caries when
used to compare larger population. The DT represents present caries
experience and MT and FT represents past caries experience.
The DMFT value in all the three case here is 7. But looking at the caries
status of each individual is different. In patient no. 1, the decay is 7 whereas
there is no filled or missing component suggesting that he is ignorant about
dental caries occurrence and treatment. Patient no 2 suggests that he is aware
of dental caries and find that tooth extraction is the only possible treatment
available. It is usually difficult to convince the patient to avail other treatment
options. The third patient is the most aware patient and is easy to handle as he
is well aware of the dental caries occurrence consequences and importance of
teeth. Hence the DMFT index is used as an aid to understand the attitude of
the patient

=== PAGE 636 ===
DECAYED-MISSING-FILLED-SURFACE (DMFS)
INDEX
The Decayed-Missing-Filled Surface Index was introduced by Henry T
Klein, Carrole. E Palmer and Knutson JW in 1938.
11
When the DMFT index is employed to assess each individual surface of
each tooth, it is termed as “Decayed-Missing-Filled-Surface Index” (DMFS
Index).
The principles, rules and criteria for DMFS Index are the same as that of
DMFT Index, which are described previously along with description of
DMFT index. The only difference here, is that the surfaces are examined.

=== PAGE 637 ===
1.
2.
Surfaces Examined
Posterior teeth
:
 Each tooth has five surfaces examined and recorded—
facial, lingual, mesial, distal and occlusal.
Anterior teeth
:
 Each tooth has four surfaces for evaluation—facial,
lingual, mesial and distal.

=== PAGE 638 ===
Total Surface Count
If 28 teeth are examined
(i.e. third molars are excluded)
16 posterior teeth (16 × 5) = 80 surfaces
12 anterior teeth (12 × 4) = 48 surfaces
Total = 128 surfaces
If third molars are included (4 × 5)
= 20 surfaces
Total = 148 surfaces

=== PAGE 639 ===
Calculation of Index
 (
Table 12.13
)
Individual DMFS
Total number of decayed surfaces = DS
Total number of missing surfaces = MS
Total number of filled surfaces = FS
DMFS score = DS + MS + FS
The DMFS index is more sensitive and is usually the index of choice in a
clinical trial of a caries preventive agent. This is because relative incidence is
more likely to be detected over the limited time period of a clinical trial. But
a DMFS examination takes longer, is more likely to produce inconsistencies
in diagnosis and may require the use of radiographs to be fully accurate.
Table 12.13:
 
Recording form dental caries missing and filled teeth index
(DMFS)


=== PAGE 640 ===
SIC Index
Caries situation in many countries show that there is a skewed distribution of
caries prevalence—meaning that a proportion of 12-year-old still has high or
even very high DMFT values even though a proportion is totally caries free.
Clearly, the mean DMFT value does not accurately reflect this skewed
distribution leading to incorrect conclusion that the caries situation for the
whole population is controlled while in reality several individuals still have
caries. A new index, the 
Significant Caries Index
 was introduced by
Bratthall. J in the year 2000
13
 in order to bring attention to the individuals
with the highest caries values in each population under investigation.
The significant caries index is calculated as follows
: Individuals are sorted
according to their DMFT values.
One-third of the population with the highest caries scores is selected.
The mean DMFT for this subgroup is calculated. This value is the SiC
index.

=== PAGE 641 ===
CARIES INDICES FOR PRIMARY DENTITION
dft Index
This is the method of choice for World Health Organization
12
 in their basic
survey techniques. Here to prevent the confusion that arise dues to exfoliation
the missing teeth are ignored. The ‘dft’ index can be applied to the whole
tooth as the decayed-filled-tooth (‘dft’ index) or the individual surfaces as the
decayed-filled-surfaces (‘dfs’ index).
Classification
Criteria
Normal (0)
The enamel represents the usual translucent
semivitriform type of structure. The surface is
smooth, glossy and usually of a pale, creamy white
colour.
Questionable (0.5)
The enamel discloses slight aberrations from the
translucency of normal enamel, ranging from a few
white flecks to occasional white spots. This
classification is used in those instances where a
definite diagnosis of the mildest form of fluorosis is
not warranted and a classification of "normal" not
justified.
Very mild (1)
Small, opaque, paper white areas scattered
irregularly over the tooth, but not involving as much
as approximately 25% of tooth surface. Frequently
included in this classification are teeth showing no
more than about 1–2 mm of white opacity at the tip
of the summit of the cusps of bicuspids or second
molars.
Mild (2)
The white opaque areas in the enamel of teeth are
more extensive, but do not involve as much as 50%
of tooth.
Moderate (3)
All enamel surfaces of the teeth are affected and
surfaces subject to attrition show wear. Brown stain
is frequently a disfiguring feature.

=== PAGE 642 ===
Severe (4)
All enamel surfaces of the tooth are affected and
hypoplasia is so marked that the general form of the
tooth may be affected. The major diagnostic sign of
this classification is discrete or confluent pitting.
Brown stains are widespread and teeth often present
a corroded-like appearance.

=== PAGE 643 ===
DEAN’S FLUOROSIS INDEX
An index for assessment of dental fluorosis was introduced by Trendley H
Dean in 1934
14
—known as ‘Dean’s classification system for dental fluorosis’
or ‘Dean’s fluorosis index’.
This classification system is the most widely adopted system for
classifying dental fluorosis in use since 1942.

=== PAGE 644 ===
Calculation
The recording is made on the basis of the two teeth that are most affected
(
Table 12.14
). If the two teeth are not equally affected, the score for the less
affected of the two should be recorded.
Table 12.14:
 
Recording form Dean’s fluorosis index


=== PAGE 645 ===
COMMUNITY FLUOROSIS INDEX (CFI)
To determine the severity of dental fluorosis as a public health problem,
Trendley H Dean in 1935
15
 devised a method of calculating the prevalence
and severity of fluorosis in a group or community, which he termed as the
“Community Fluorosis Index” (CFI).
6
CFI numerical statistical values (weights) as a score for each degree of
mottling. Each individual is allotted a score according to the following scale:
Fluorosis category
Numerical weight
Normal
0
Questionable
0.5
Very mild
1
Mild
2
Moderate
3
Severe
4
The score assigned to an individual is the one which corresponds to the
two most severely affected teeth in the mouth.
On the basis of the number and distribution of the individual scores, a
community index of dental fluorosis (CFI) can be calculated (Dean 1942)
using the formula.
Range of scores for community

0.5–1.0
Slight
1.0–2.0
Medium
2.0–3.0
Marked
3.0–4.0
Very marked

=== PAGE 646 ===
In 1946, Dean HT related the numerical scale of CFI to what he defined
as the ‘Public Health Significance of Community Fluorosis Index Scores’,
which is as follows:
‘Dean’ did not consider CFI scores below 0.4 to have Public Health
significance. Scores that ranged between 0.4 and 0.6 were of borderline
significance and CFI scores above 0.6. were of increasing public health
concern as they progressed to a maximum of 4.0.

Limitations
Clarkson summarizes as follows:
Since the index is based on the two most severely affected teeth, it does
not allow for measurement of other teeth.
Gives no indication of the extent of defects or the tooth surfaces
affected.
The use of the term “questionable” is too vague.
The index appears to describe the milder forms of fluorosis accurately,
but is not sensitive enough to differentiate between fluorosis in high-
fluoride areas.
The statistical basis for using the authentic mean to calculate the CFI is
questionable. Further the classification is based on an ordinal and not
an interval scale.
The CFI, because of its method of calculation, may not give a true
reflection of the severity of fluorosis within a community.

ANGLE’S SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION
Edward Angle introduced a system of classifying malocclusion in the year
1899.
16
 Based on the relation of the lower first permanent molar to the upper
first permanent molar, he classified malocclusions into three main classes
designated by the Roman numerals I, II and III.
Angle classified malocclusion into the following broad categories
Class I
Class II
Division 1
Division 2
Class III

=== PAGE 649 ===
Angle’s Class I
The mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first permanent molar occludes in the
buccal groove of mandibular first permanent molar. The patient may exhibit
dental irregularities such as crowding, spacing, rotations, missing teeth, etc.

=== PAGE 650 ===
Angle’s Class II
The distobuccal cusp of the upper first permanent molar occludes in the
buccal groove of the lower first permanent molar. Angle has sub-classified
class II malocclusions into two divisions—division 1 and division 2.
Class II, Division 1
The Class II, division 1 malocclusion is characterized by proclined upper
incisors with a resultant increase in overjet. A deep incisor overbite can occur
in the anterior region. A characteristic feature of this malocclusion is the
presence of abnormal muscle activity. The upper lip is usually hypotonic,
short and fails to form a lip seal. The lower lip cushions the palatal aspect of
the upper teeth, a feature typical of a Class II, division 1 referred to as “lip
trap”.
Class II, Division 2
As in Class II, division 1 malocclusion, the division 2 also exhibits a Class II
molar relationship. The classic feature of this malocclusion is the presence of
lingually inclined upper central incisors and labially tipped upper lateral
incisors overlapping the central incisors.
Class II, Sub-division
When a Class II molar relation exists on one side and a Class I relation on the
other side, it is referred to as Class II, sub-division. Based on whether it is a
division 1 or division 2 it can be called Class I, division 2, sub-division or
Class II, division 2, sub-division.

=== PAGE 651 ===

Angle’s Class III
This malocclusion exhibits a Class III molar relation with the mesiobuccal
cusp of the maxillary first permanent molar occluding in the interdental space
between the mandibular first and second molars. Class III malocclusion can
be classified into true Class III and pseudoClass III.
True Class III
This is a skeletal Class III malocclusion of genetic origin that can occur due
to the following causes:
Excessively large mandible.
Forwardly placed mandible.
Smaller than normal maxilla.
Retropositioned maxilla.
Combination of the above causes.
Patients can present with a normal overjet, an edge-to-edge incisor
relation or an anterior crossbite.
Pseudo-Class III
This type of malocclusion is produced by a forward movement of the
mandible during jaw closure, thus it is also called “postural” or “habitual”
Class III malocclusion.
Class III, Sub-division
This is a condition characterized by a Class III molar relation on one side and
a Class I relation on the other side.

Drawbacks of Angle’s Classification
Angle considered malocclusion only in the anteroposterior plane. He
did not consider malocclusions in the transverse and vertical planes.
Angle considered the first permanent molars as fixed points in the
skull. But this is not found to be so.
The classification cannot be applied, if the first permanent molars are
extracted or missing.
The classification cannot be applied to the deciduous dentition.
The classification does not differentiate between skeletal and dental
malocclusions.
The classification does not highlight the aetiology of malocclusion.
Individual tooth malpositions have not been considered by Angle.

Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN)
The Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) was developed by Shaw,
Richmond and O’Brien at Manchester Dental School in the 1990s.
17
 They
were based on a number of existing orthodontic indices. Since then the UK
National Health survey (NHS) has introduced their use to limit access to
orthodontic care.
IOTN has two components
: Dental Health Component (DHC) and
Aesthetic Component (AC). In the NHS, patients must score IOTN 4 or 5 for
treatment. In patients with IOTN 3, the aesthetic component is applied, those
patients with an IOTN DHC score of 3 and an IOTN AC score of 6 or
greater, qualify for treatment.
The dental health component (DHC) has 5 grades:
IOTN 1
Almost perfection
IOTN 2
Minor irregularities
IOTN 3
Greater irregularities which normally do not need
treatment for health reasons
IOTN 4
More severe degrees of irregularity and these do
require treatment for health reasons
IOTN 5
Severe dental health problems
Grade 1: No treatment need
Extremely minor malocclusion with contact point displacements of less
than 1 mm.
Grade 2: Minor anomaly, no treatment need
Overjet >3.5 mm and ≤6 mm (with competent lip closing)
Reverse overjet between 0 and ≤1 mm
Anterior or posterior crossbite with 1 mm discrepancy between RCP
and ICP
Contact point displacements >1 mm and ≤2 mm
Anterior or posterior open bite >1 mm and ≤2 mm

The Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI), developed in the United States of
America

CLASSIFICATION AND STAGING OF MOUTH
CANCER AND JAW TUMOURS
A universally acceptable classification system for cancer of the oral cavity is
essential for clinical research and prognostic determination. The aim of such
a classification is to obtain homogeneous statistically equivalent groups of
patients or the purpose of assessing evaluating and comparing various
therapeutic approaches. Another equally important purpose is the comparison
of the efficacy of any given method of treatment in patients attending
different hospitals.
The first acceptable classification for squamous tumours was developed
by Pierre Denoix, between 1943 and 1952
18
 based on extent of the primary
tumour (T) the regional node (N) status and the presence or absence of distant
metastases (M). This TNM classification has been the basis for all later
systems.The development of a new classification and staging is proposed by
JD Langdon.

=== PAGE 659 ===
Definition
TNM classification is a clinical classification and as such the information
provided is entirely dependent upon the personal experience on opinions and
skills of the examining clinician.
This was achieved by recording the size and degree of infiltration of the
primary tumour (T) the presence and condition of the associated regional
lymph nodes (N) and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M).
When carefully evaluated, these variables should give an indication of the
prognosis and help the clinician in the choice of treatment.

=== PAGE 660 ===

Need for Classification
Before the start of treatment for a patient with oral cancer; the patient’s
disease must be carefully evaluated.
Clinical assessment includes an exhaustive history, physical examination
and laboratory and radiological studies, the purposes of which are to
determine the extent of the tumour and the presence or absence of
demonstrable regional lymph nodes or distant metastases. Every tumour
should be biopsied and a histo-pathological diagnosis must be determined
before the initiation of treatment. Because cancers arising from different sites
in the oral cavity have distinctive clinical features, courses and prognosis, an
individual therapeutic approach must be tailored for each patient.
The many therapeutic strategies that have been used in cancer of the head
and neck suggest that a universally applicable form of treatment for a
particular tumour in a specific stage of advancement in an individual patient
is entirely dependent upon a meaningful comparison of the end results of
similar cases reported from different centres. For these reasons, a
classification system is essential, at present an ideal system does not exist.
Every classification system has the same basic concept of grouping
together homogeneous and comparable elements for subsequent analysis. For
reporting purposes, it is desirable to group together those permutations of T,
N and M for which there is a similar survival rate. The prime purpose of such
staging is to determine what forms of treatment will most favourably alter the
natural course of the disease and any staging procedure must correlate with
the actual survival of the patients.
The coordination of the data with particular clinical observation that
patients with less extensive primary tumours have a longer survival time than
those with extensive tumours.
In the most recent Union Internationale Centre le Cancer (UICC) TNM
classification, two classifications are described for each tumour:
Pretreatment clinical classification (cTNM). This is based on evidence
acquired prior to the decision as to definitive treatment. Such evidence
arises from clinical, radiological and other investigations.
Postsurgical histopathological classification (pTNH). This is based on
the evidence given in point 1 above supplemented by the surgical

findings and the examination of the therapeutically resected specimen.
This predisposes that all treatment will be surgical. As applied to the
oral cavity, the TNM pretreatment classification is as follows:
Primary tumour
Primary tumour cannot be assessed
No evidence of primary tumour
Preinvasive carcinoma (carcinoma-in situ)
Tumour 2 cm or less in its greater dimension
Tumour more than 2 cm but no more than 4 cm in its greatest
dimension.
Tumour more than 4 cm in its greatest dimension.
Tumour invades adjacent structures, e.g. through cortical bone, into
deep (extrinsic) muscles of tongue, maxillary sinus, skin.
Regional lymph nodes
Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
No regional lymph node metastasis
Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node 3 cm or less in its greatest
dimension
Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node more than 3 cm but not
more than 6 cm or in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than
6 cm in its greatest dimension.
Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node more than 3 cm but not
more than 6 cm in its greatest dimension. N2b: Metastasis in multiple
ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in its greatest diinension.
Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6
cm in its greatest dimension.
Metastasis in a lymph node more than 6 cm in its greatest dimension.
Distant metastasis MX: Presence of distant metastasis cannot be
assessed.
No distant metastases
Distant metastases

The postsurgical histopathological classification uses the same categories
for pT, pN and pM.
In addition, a histopathological grading (G) has now been introduced:
Grade of differentiation cannot be assessed
Well differentiated
Moderately differentiated
Poorly differentiated
The absence or presence of residual tumour after treatment is described by
the symbol R
:
Presence of residual tumour cannot be assessed
No residual tumour
Microscopic residual tumour
Macroscopic residual tumour
The stage grouping in his current UICC classification is as follows:
No account is taken of histopathological grading. This most recent UICC-
TNM classification, although a development of earlier systems, has now
become so complicated that its value is in doubt. Many of the specific criteria
are confusing. For example, no importance is attached to fixation of lymph
nodes.
Carcinomatous deposits in the regional lymph nodes from the primary
lesion commonly occur in patients with oral cancer. Successful treatment of
such spread requires a knowledge of lymphatic drainage and an awareness of
the difficulties in the clinical assessment of the regional nodes. Considerable

=== PAGE 663 ===
difficulty arises in making a clinical distinction between those palpable nodes
considered to contain near lesser and those considered to be enlarged due to
reactionary hyperplasia or secondary infection.

=== PAGE 664 ===
Staging
All graduations of prognosis can be demonstrated by grouping the patients on
the basis of the size of the primary tumour (T), the presence or absence of
involved nodes (N) and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M)
into groups with a similar survival rate.
The prime purpose of staining is that by knowing the prognosis,
appropriate treatment can be selected which will most favourably alter the
natural course of the disease. Any staging procedure must correlate with a
reasonable spread of survival data.

WHO ASSESSMENT FORM
20
Basic oral health surveys provide a sound basis for assessing the current oral
health status of a population and its future needs for oral health care. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has a long tradition of epidemiological
survey methodology, which includes a description of the diagnostic criteria
that can be readily understood and applied in public health programmes
worldwide. Guidelines have been elaborated for practical and economical
sample designs suitable for recording the prevalence of oral diseases required
for planning oral health programmes. The World Health Organization (WHO)
has a long tradition of epidemiological survey methodology and surveillance
in oral health. Ever since 1971, the oral health assessment form has been the
gold standard for recording and surveillance. The last updated version of
2013 is now in current use. The standard oral health assessment form for
adults includes the following sections:
Survey identification information
General information
Extraoral conditions
Dentition status (crown, root)
Periodontal status
Loss of attachment
Enamel fluorosis
Dental erosion
Dental trauma
Oral mucosal lesions
Denture status (fixed or removable dentures)
Intervention urgency and need for referral notes.
The corresponding standard oral health assessment form for children includes
the following sections:
Survey identification
General information

=== PAGE 666 ===
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Dentition status
Gingival status
Enamel fluorosis
Dental erosion
Dental trauma
Oral mucosal lesions
Intervention
Urgency.
With regard to oral mucosal lesions, if the sample consists only of
children, a decision may be made to record only those lesions that are
frequently observed in children rather than all the lesions that may occur in
adults. It is strongly recommended that the appropriate form is used when
surveying children or adults.

=== PAGE 667 ===
Identification and General Information Sections
The investigator should write the name of the country in which the survey is
being conducted in capital letters on the original assessment form before
making additional copies. Boxes 1–4 on the form are reserved for the WHO
code for the country in which the survey will be carried out and should not be
filled in by the investigator.
Essential information includes year, month and day of examination
(Boxes 5–10). The identification number is the unique identifier for the
individual person under examination (Boxes 11–14); codes are also given to
indicate whether the examination is the original or duplicate examination
(Box 15) and by the individual examiner responsible for the examination
(Boxes 16 and 17).
In the general information section, the following points are recorded—the
name (write-in response if permissible to record), sex (Box 18), date of birth
(Boxes 19–24), age (Boxes 25 and 26), ethnic group (Boxes 27 and 28), other
group (Boxes 29 and 30), years attended school (Boxes 31 and 32),
occupation (Box 33), geographical location/community (Boxes 34 and 35),
type of location (Box 36), and other survey specific data (Boxes 37–42).
Findings from the extraoral examination are recorded in Boxes 43 and 44.
Date of Examination (Boxes 5–10)
The year, month and day should be recorded on the form at the time of
examination. Recording the day enables an investigator to refer back to
examinations held on any particular day which may need to be reviewed or
checked.
Identification Number (Boxes 11–14)
Each subject examined should be given an identification number. This
number should always have the same number of digits as the total number of
subjects to be examined. Thus, if it is intended to examine 1200 subjects, the
first subject should be numbered 0001.
If possible, the identification numbers should be entered on the forms
before commencing the examinations for the day, because it is important to
ensure that each identification number is used only once. Cross-checking is

=== PAGE 668 ===
necessary when more than one examiner is participating in a survey. If a total
of 1200 subjects are to be surveyed by two examiners, examiner 1 should use
the numbers 0001–0600 and examiner 2 should use 0601–1200.
Original or Duplication Examination (Box 15)
If the subject will be re-examined to assess reproducibility, the first (original)
examination is scored “1” and any subsequent, duplication examinations are
coded “2”, “3”, “4”, etc. in Box 15. For all subjects for whom duplicate
examinations have been made, data from the first examination only are
included in the survey analysis. To assess intraexaminer reproducibility, the
first (original) examination is coded “1” and the second examination
performed by the same examiner is coded “2”. When the findings of the
survey are analysed, the level of intra-examiner reproducibility, denoted by
the percentage of agreement and the kappa statistic, can be calculated and
reported. It is important that the method selected is clearly explained to avoid
misinterpretations in data entry.
Examiner (Boxes 16 and 17)
If more than one examiner is participating in the survey, each examiner
should be assigned a specific code, which should be entered in Boxes 16 and
17. If a validating examiner is participating in the survey, he or she should
also be assigned a specific code.
Name
The name of the subject may be written in block letters, beginning with the
family name. It should be noted that, in some countries, identification of
survey subjects by name is not permitted, in which case this space should be
left blank.
Sex (Box 18)
This information should be recorded at the time of examination because it is
not always possible to tell a person’s sex from the name alone (which may or
may not be recorded). The relevant code (1 = male, 2 = female) is entered in
Box 18.
Date 
of Birth (Boxes 19–24)

=== PAGE 669 ===
Where possible, the year (Boxes 19 and 20), month (Boxes 21 and 22), and
day of birth (Boxes 23 and 24) should be entered for crosschecking purposes.
Age (Boxes 25 and 26)
Age should be recorded as age at last birthday (e.g. a child in the thirteenth
year of life is 12 years old). If the age is less than 10 years, enter “0” in Box
25 (e.g. 6 years is coded as “06”). In communities where age is expressed in
different terms, a conversion must be made. If the age of the subject is not
known, it may be necessary to make an estimate on the basis of, for instance,
status of tooth eruption or, for adults, major life events or occasions in the
community. Where age has been estimated, the manner of estimation should
be reported.
Ethnic Group (Boxes 27 and 28)
In different countries, ethnic and other groups are identified in different ways,
by area or country of origin, race, colour, language, religion or tribal
membership. Local health and education authorities should be consulted
before making a decision about the relevant ethnic group
classification/coding scheme to be used.
More than 10 ethnic groups may officially exist in a country; therefore, a
two-digit entry code should be used. Since it is often not possible to identify a
person’s ethnic origin from their name alone, ethnic group information must
be recorded at the time of the examination from information provided by the
subject/parent. In some countries, information on ethnicity may be obtained
from government agencies or school administrative data at the time of sample
selection.
Other Group (Boxes 29 and 30)
Codes may be used to identify different subpopulation groups.
Number of Years in School (Boxes 31 and 32)
This information is useful for assessment of the level of education, which is
important factor in the analysis of oral health. In children, the boxes may be
used for recording the school grade achieved by a child.

=== PAGE 670 ===
1.
2.
3.
Occupation (Box 33)
A coding system should be devised according to local usage to identify
different occupations and the appropriate code entered.
Community—Geographical Location (Boxes 34 and 35)
In these surveys, using codes to identify schools as part of the survey is
important since the information obtained on oral health status can be used for
planning strategies applicable to specific age groups in a particular school.
Once the schools have been selected, the codes can be designated.
Boxes 34 and 35 should be used to record the site where the examination
is being conducted. This allows geographical locations (villages, etc.) to be
identified (01–98). A list giving each location and its code number should be
prepared. Usually, just a few codes are needed. The code “99” should be
entered, if this information is not recorded.
Community information is very useful for health administrators for
planning or revising programmes or strategies. If samples of drinking water
are collected during the survey, the name of the community will be essential
in mapping of fluoride in drinking water supplies and determining whether
the concentration is below, at or above optimal levels.
Location Type (Box 36)
The rationale for including these data is to obtain general information about
local environmental conditions and the availability of services at each site.
Three codes are used:
Urban site.
Periurban area
: This has been included in order to indicate areas
surrounding major towns that may have characteristics similar to those
of rural areas, with very few health facilities of any kind and usually
with no or limited access to oral healthcare facilities.
Rural area or small village.
Other Data (Boxes 37–42)
Fields are provided for entering a two-digit code for up to three conditions or

=== PAGE 671 ===
data to be recorded. Conditions and codes must be agreed prior to
commencing the survey. These fields have been provided for recording other
information about the subjects examined or the survey location. Information
such as exposure to a specific oral health programme, use of tobacco or
chewing sticks, refugee status, socioeconomic status, physical environment,
and level of fluoride in drinking water can be recorded here; if sugar intake
was of interest, a coding system could be designed by the investigator
whereby the amount and frequency of intake were given suitable codes.
Additionally, two boxes are reserved for recording any abnormality
identified by the examiner during extraoral examination of the orofacial
complex.

=== PAGE 672 ===
Clinical Examination (Boxes 43 and 44)
The oral cavity is part of the orofacial complex and examiners should record
any evident abnormality of the tissues of the face, nose, cheek or chin. The
condition and its location are recorded using the following recommended
codes.
Condition (Box 43)
0 = Normal
1 = Ulceration, sores
2 = Erosions
3 = Fissures
4 = Cancrum oris
5 = Enlarged lymph nodes
6 = Any other abnormalities 9 = Not recorded
Location (Box 44)
1 = Face
2 = Neck
3 = Nose
4 = Cheeks
5 = Chin
6 = Commissures
7 = Vermillion border
8 = Jaws

=== PAGE 673 ===

Dentition Status
(Boxes 45–108 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for Adults and 45–72 in
the Oral Health Assessment Form for Children)
The examination for dental caries should be conducted with a plane mouth
mirror. The use of radiography for detection of approximal caries is not
recommended because the equipment is impractical to utilize in most field
situations. Likewise, the use of fibreoptics is not recommended. Although it
is recognized that both these diagnostic aids reduce the underestimation of
dental caries, logistical complications and frequent objections on the part of
subjects to exposure to radiation outweigh any potential gains.
Examiners should adopt a systematic approach to the assessment of the
dentition status, bearing the following points in mind: The examination
should proceed in an orderly manner from one tooth or tooth space to the
adjacent tooth or tooth space;
A tooth should be considered present in the mouth when any part of it
is visible.
If a permanent and primary tooth occupy the same tooth space, the
status of the permanent tooth only should be recorded.
Permanent dentition status (crown and roots) is recorded using numbered
scores and the primary dentition status is recorded using letter in the same
boxes. Boxes 45–76 are used for upper teeth and Boxes 77–108 for lower
teeth. The corresponding boxes for the Oral Health Assessment
Forms for Children are Boxes 45–58 and 59–72
.
An entry must be made in every box pertaining to the coronal and root
status of a tooth. In children, root status is not assessed; therefore the
corresponding boxes have been omitted in the Oral Health Assessment Form
for Children.
Considerable care should be taken to identify tooth-coloured fillings,
which may be extremely difficult to detect (
Table 12.16
).
Table 12.16:
 
Coding the dentition status—primary and permanent teeth

=== PAGE 674 ===

•

•
The criteria for diagnosing a tooth status and the coding are as follows
(codes applied to primary teeth are given in parentheses):
Sound crown
. A crown is coded as sound, if it shows no evidence of
treated or untreated clinical caries (
see
 Plate 1, code
A, and Plate 6, code 0). The stages of caries that precede cavitation, as
well as other conditions similar to the early stages of caries, are
excluded because they cannot be reliably identified in most field
conditions in which epidemiological surveys are conducted. Thus, a
crown with the following defects, in the absence of other positive
criteria, should be coded as sound:
White or chalky spots; discoloured or rough spots that are not
soft to touch with a metal CPI probe;
Stained enamel pits or fissures that do not have visible cavitation
or softening of the floor or walls detectable with a CPI probe;
Dark, shiny, hard, pitted areas of enamel in a tooth showing
signs of moderate to severe enamel fluorosis;
Lesions that, on the basis of their distribution or history, or on
examination, appear to be due to abrasion.
Sound root
. A root is recorded as sound when it is exposed and shows

=== PAGE 675 ===
1(B)
2(C)
3(D)
no evidence of treated or untreated clinical caries.
Carious crown
. Caries is recorded as present when a lesion in a pit or
fissure, or on a smooth tooth surface, has an unmistakable cavity,
undermined enamel, or a detectably softened floor. A tooth with a
temporary filling, or one which is sealed but also decayed, should also
be included in this category. In cases where the crown has been
destroyed by caries and only the root is left, the caries is judged to have
originated in the crown and is, therefore, scored as crown caries only.
The CPI probe should be used to confirm visual evidence of caries on
the tooth surface(s). Where any doubt exists, caries should not be
recorded as present. 
Carious root
. Caries is recorded as present when a
lesion feels soft or leathery on probing with the CPI probe. If the
carious lesion on the root does not involve the crown, it should be
recorded as root caries. For single carious lesions affecting both the
crown and the root, the likely site of origin of the lesion should be
recorded as the decayed site. When it is not possible to identify the site
of origin, both the crown and the root should be coded as decayed. In
general, root caries is not recorded for children and in youth or young
adults.
Filled crown, with caries
. A crown is considered filled, with decay,
when it has one or more permanent restorations and one or more areas
that are decayed. No distinction is made between primary and
secondary caries and the same code applies regardless of whether the
carious lesions are in contact with the restoration(s).
Filled root, with caries
. A root is considered filled, with caries, when it
has one or more permanent restorations and one or more areas that are
decayed. No distinction is made between primary and secondary caries.
In the case of restorations involving both the crown and the root,
identification of the site of origin is more difficult. For any restoration
involving both the crown and the root with secondary caries, the most
likely site of the primary carious lesion is recorded as filled, with
decay. When it is not possible to identify the site of origin of the
primary carious lesion, both the crown and the root should be coded as
filled, with caries.
Filled crown, with no caries
. A crown is considered filled, without
caries, when one or more permanent restorations are present and there

=== PAGE 676 ===
7(G)
4(E)
5(–)
is no caries anywhere on the crown. A tooth that has been crowned
because of previous decay is recorded in this category. A tooth that has
been crowned for reasons other than caries by means of a fixed dental
prosthesis abutment is coded.
Filled root, with no caries
. A root is considered filled, without caries,
when one or more permanent restorations are present and there is no
caries anywhere on the root. In the case of fillings involving both the
crown and the root, identification of the site of origin is more difficult.
For any restoration involving both the crown and the root, the most
likely site of the primary carious lesion is recorded as filled. When it is
not possible to identify the site of origin, both the crown and the root
should be coded as filled.
Missing tooth, due to caries
. This code is used for permanent or
primary teeth that have been extracted because of caries and are
recorded under coronal status. For missing primary teeth, this score
should be used only if the subject is at an age when normal exfoliation
would not be a sufficient explanation for absence.
Note:
 The root status of a tooth that has been scored as missing
because of caries should be coded “7” or “9”
.
In some age groups, it may be difficult to distinguish between
unerupted teeth (code 8) and missing teeth (codes 4 or 5). Basic
knowledge of tooth eruption patterns, the appearance of the alveolar
ridge in the area of the tooth space in question, and the caries status of
other teeth in the mouth may provide helpful clues in deciding whether
a tooth is unerupted or has been extracted. Code 4 should not be used
for teeth deemed to be missing for any reason other than caries. For
convenience, in fully edentulous arches, a single “4” should be placed
in Boxes 45 and 60; and 77–92, as appropriate, and the respective pairs
of numbers linked with straight lines. Such procedure may also be
applied where the record form for registration at tooth surface level is
used.
Permanent tooth missing due to any other reason
. This code is used for
permanent teeth deemed to be absent congenitally, or extracted for
orthodontic reasons or because of periodontal disease, trauma, etc. As
for code 4, two entries of code 5 can be linked by a line in cases of
fully edentulous arches.

=== PAGE 677 ===
6(F)
7(G)
8(–)
9(–)
Note:
 The root status of a tooth scored 5 should be coded “7” or “9”
.
Fissure sealant
. This code is used for teeth in which a fissure sealant
has been placed on the occlusal surface, in pits or for teeth in which the
occlusal fissure has been enlarged with a rounded or “flameshaped”
bur, and a composite material placed. If a tooth with a sealant has
caries, it should be coded as 1 or B.
Fixed dental prosthesis abutment, special crown or veneer
. This code
is used under coronal status to indicate that a tooth forms part of a
fixed bridge abutment. This code can also be used for crowns placed
for reasons other than caries and for veneers or laminates covering the
labial surface of a tooth, on which there is no evidence of caries or a
restoration. 
Note: Missing teeth replaced by fixed partial denture
pontics are coded 4 or 5 under coronal status, while root status is
scored 9
. This code is used under root status to indicate that an implant
has been placed as an abutment.
Unerupted tooth (crown)
. This classification is restricted to permanent
teeth and used only for a tooth space with an unerupted permanent
tooth but no primary tooth. Teeth scored as unerupted are excluded
from all calculations concerning dental caries. This category does not
include congenitally missing teeth, or teeth lost as a result of trauma,
etc. For differential diagnosis between missing and unerupted teeth, see
code 5.
Unexposed root
. This code indicates that the root surface is not
exposed; there is no gingival recession beyond the cemento-enamel
junction (CEJ).
Not recorded
. This code is used for an erupted permanent tooth that
cannot be examined for any reason such as orthodontic bands, severe
hypoplasia, etc. This code is used under root status to indicate either
that the tooth has been extracted or that calculus is present to such an
extent that root examination is not possible.

=== PAGE 678 ===
Dental Caries Indices: Tooth (DMFT, dmft) and
Surface (DMFS, dmfs) Levels
Information on the Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth Index (DMFT) can be
derived directly from the data in Boxes 45–76 and 77–108. The D component
includes all teeth with codes 1 or 2. The M component comprises teeth coded
4 in subjects under 30 years of age, and teeth coded 4 or 5 in subjects 30
years and older, i.e. missing due to caries or for any other reason. The F
component includes teeth only with code 3. The basis for DMFT calculations
is 32 teeth, i.e. all permanent teeth including wisdom teeth. Teeth coded 6
(fissure sealant) or 7 (fixed dental prosthesis/bridge abutment, special crown
or veneer/implant) are not included in calculations of the DMFT index. In the
case of the primary teeth, the calculation of the dmft index is similar, i.e. by
deriving information from data codes A, B, C and D and E in the oral health
assessment form.
When a survey is undertaken for a particular purpose, e.g. evaluation of a
disease prevention programme, planners may wish to record dentition status
by tooth surface and to calculate the DMFS and dmfs indices.
A DMFT index applicable to roots can easily be calculated as data for
each tooth are collected during examination; this index is especially relevant
in older population groups.

Periodontal Status: Community Periodontal Index
(CPI) Modified
Two indicators of periodontal status are used for this assessment: Gingival
bleeding and periodontal pockets. A specially designed, lightweight CPI
metallic probe with a 0.5 mm ball tip is used, with a black band between 3.5
and 5.5 mm, and rings at 8.5 and 11.5 mm from the ball tip (
Fig. 12.5
)
(19)
. All
teeth present in the mouth are examined for absence or presence of gingival
bleeding and absence or presence of periodontal pockets; pocket depth is
measured with the WHO CPI periodontal probe.
Assessing for Gingival Bleeding and Measuring
Periodontal Pockets
Gingivae of all teeth present in the mouth should be examined by carefully
inserting the tip of the WHO CPI probe between the gingiva and the tooth to
assess absence or presence of bleeding response. The sensing force used
should be no more than 20 g. A practical test for establishing this force is to
ask examiners to place the probe point under their thumbnail and press until
blanching occurs. Alternatively, examiners can use a mirror and insert the
probe into the gingival sulcus of their own anterior teeth using the lightest
possible force that will allow movement of the probe ball tip along the tooth
surface. These exercises should be conducted as part of the training when
examiners are calibrated for reliability and consistency.
When the probe is inserted, the ball tip should follow the anatomical
configuration of the surface of the tooth root. If the subject being examined
feels pain during probing, this is indicative of the use of too much force. The
probe tip should be inserted gently into the gingival sulcus or pocket and the
full extent of the sulcus or pocket explored. For example, place the probe in
the pocket at the distobuccal surface of the second molar, as close as possible
to the contact point with the third molar, keeping the probe parallel to the
long axis of the tooth. Move the probe gently, with short upward and
downward movements, along the buccal sulcus or pocket, to the mesial
surface of the second molar. A similar procedure is carried out for lingual
surfaces, starting on the distolingual aspect of the second molar.
All teeth present should be probed and scored in the corresponding box.

=== PAGE 680 ===
Periodontal pockets are not recorded in individuals younger than 15 years of
age. The codes for scoring bleeding and pocketing are given below.

=== PAGE 681 ===
Gingival Bleeding Scores

Adults; Boxes 73–86 and 87–100 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for
Children)

2 = Pocket 6 mm or more.
9 = Tooth excluded.
X = Tooth not present.
Loss of Attachment (Boxes 173–178 Oral Health
Assessment Form for Adults)
Information on loss of attachment may be collected from the index teeth. The
CPI system is designed to obtain an estimate of the lifetime accumulated
destruction of the periodontal attachment and thereby permits comparisons
between population groups. It is not designed to describe the full extent of
loss of attachment in an individual. Loss of attachment is recorded by
dividing the mouth in sextants, defined by tooth numbers: 18–14, 13–23,
2428, 38–34, 33–43, and 44–48. The most reliable method of examination for
loss of attachment in each sextant is to record this immediately after
recording the gingival status and pocket scores. As mentioned above, loss of
attachment should not be recorded for individuals under the age of 15.

Index Teeth
The index teeth, which are the teeth to be examined, are 16/17, 11, 26/17,
36/37, 31, 46/47. The two molars in each posterior sextant are paired for
recording and, if one is missing, there is no replacement. If no index tooth is
present in a sextant qualifying for examination, all the teeth that are present in
that sextant are examined and the highest score is recorded as the score for
the sextant.
The extent of loss of attachment is recorded using the CPI probe and
applying the following codes:
0–3 mm

Enamel Fluorosis
(Box 179 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for Adults; Box 101 in the
Oral Health Assessment Form for Children)
Fluorotic lesions are usually bilaterally symmetrical and tend to show a
horizontal striated pattern across the tooth. The premolars and second molars
are most frequently affected, followed by the maxillary incisors. The
mandibular incisors are least affected.
The examiner should note the distribution pattern of any defects, using
Dean’s index criteria, and make a decision as to whether they are typical of
fluorosis. Defects falling into the “questionable” to “mild” categories—the
conditions most likely to be encountered—may consist of fine white lines or
patches and tend to fade into the surrounding enamel. To facilitate
differentiating fluorosis lesions from other opacities not related to fluoride, it
is important to remember that fluorosis lesions are usually observed near the
edges of incisors or cusp tips; however, depending on severity, the lesions
may be readily apparent on other areas of the tooth and be readily visible in
premolars and molars. Nonfluoride-related opacities can be localized to the
centre of the smooth surface, although they can affect the entire crown.
Fluorosis lesions generally appear as fine lines, frosted in appearance and
non-fluoride opacities appear round or oval in shape. Fluorosis lesions also
can be more easily observed with the light directed in a tangential direction
whereas nonfluoride opacities can be easily observed with the light directed
perpendicularly to the tooth surface.
Coding is done on the basis of the two most severely affected teeth. If the
two teeth are not equally severely affected, the score is based on the
appearance of the less affected tooth. When the teeth are scored, the examiner
should start at the higher end of the index, “severe”, and eliminate each score
until he or she arrives at the condition present. If there is any doubt, the lower
score should be given.
The codes and criteria are as follows:
= 
Normal
. Enamel surface is smooth, glossy and usually a pale creamy-
white colour.
Questionable
. The enamel shows slight aberrations in the translucent

normal enamel and which may range from a few white flecks to
occasional spots.
Very mild
. Small, opaque, paper-white areas scattered irregularly over
the tooth but involving less than 25% of the labial tooth surface.
Mild
. White opacities of the enamel involving more than 25% (
see
Code 2) but less than 50% of the tooth surface
Moderate
. The enamel surfaces show marked wear, and brown staining
is frequently a disfiguring feature.
Severe
. The enamel surfaces are severely affected and the hypoplasia is
so marked that the general form of the tooth may be affected. There are
pitted or worn areas and brown stains are widespread; the teeth often
have a corroded appearance

Dental Erosion
(Boxes 180–182 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for Adults; Boxes 102–
104 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for Children)
Data on prevalence, severity and number of teeth affected by dental erosion
would assist public health administrators in estimating whether this condition
is a public health problem. Dental erosion results from the progressive loss of
calcified dental tissue by chemical processes not associated with bacterial
action. Enamel tissue is lost by exposure to acids which may come from
dietary sources or may be intrinsic, i.e. in individuals suffering from bulimia,
gastro-oesophageal reflux or heavy alcohol consumption and chronic vomit.
The following codes (1–3) are used where the crown of a tooth shows an
erosion lesion at different levels:
No sign of erosion
Enamel lesion
Dentinal lesion
Pulp involvement
Severity of dental erosion is recorded according to the tooth with the
highest score of erosion. In addition, the number of teeth involved is
recorded.

Treated injury
Enamel fracture only
Enamel and dentin fracture
Pulp involvement
Missing tooth due to trauma

In addition to the degree/status of trauma, the severity of dental trauma
can be measured in terms of the number of teeth involved.

Oral Mucosal Lesions
(Boxes 186–191 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for Adults; Boxes 108–

The oral mucosa and soft tissues in and around the mouth should be
examined in every subject. The examination should be thorough and
systematic, and performed in the following sequence:
Labial mucosa and labial sulci (upper and lower)
Labial part of the commissures and buccal mucosa (right and left)
Tongue (dorsal and ventral surfaces, margins)
Floor of the mouth
Hard and soft palate
Alveolar ridges/gingiva (upper and lower).
Either two plane mouth mirrors or one mirror and the handle of the
periodontal probe can be used to retract the tissues. Boxes 186–188 (108–110
in children) should be used to record the absence, presence, or 
suspected
presence of the conditions coded 1–7. Examiners should be alert to, and can
make a tentative diagnosis for, these conditions during clinical examination.
Code 8 should be used to record a condition not mentioned in the list; for
example, hairy leukoplakia or Kaposi sarcoma. Whenever possible, the
tentative diagnosis should be specified in the space provided, for up to three
conditions.
The following codes apply for adults:
No abnormal condition
Malignant tumour (oral cancer)
Leukoplakia
Lichen planus
Ulceration (aphthous, herpetic, traumatic)

Intervention Urgency
(Box 194 in the Oral Health Assessment Form for Adults; Box 114 in the
Oral Health Assessment Form for Children)
It is the responsibility of the examiner or team leader to ensure that referral to
an appropriate healthcare facility is made, if needed. There is a need for
immediate care if pain, infection or serious illness is present or is likely to
occur unless treatment is provided within a certain period of time. This period
may vary from a few days to a month, depending on the availability of oral
health services. Examples of conditions that require immediate attention are
periapical abscess and ANUG. Advanced dental caries and chronic alveolar
abscesses may also be recorded in this box. A life-threatening condition (oral
cancer or precancerous lesions) or any other severe condition that is a clear
oral manifestation of a systemic disease should have been recorded in the oral
mucosa section and a code should also be entered in Box 194 in the form for
adults or in Box 114 in the form for children.
The following intervention urgency codes are recommended
:
No treatment needed
Preventive or routine treatment needed
Prompt treatment including scaling needed
Immediate (urgent) treatment needed due to pain or infection of dental
and/or oral origin
Referred for comprehensive evaluation or medical/dental treatment
(systemic condition).

=== PAGE 698 ===
PLANNING
The increasing demand for medical and health care services, in the face of
limited resources has brought out the need for careful planning and
management of health services. Planning a programme requires a deep
understanding of the system as a whole and the individuals that make up the
system. It is a dynamic process which must remain flexible and responsive to
the presentation of new factors.
Hence 
planning
 is “the systematic approach to defining the problem,
setting priorities, developing specific goals and objectives, determining
alternative strategies and a method of implementation.
1
A 
plan
 is a “decision about a course of action” [EC Banfield].

To eliminate wasteful expenditure or duplication of expenditure;
To develop the best course of action to accomplish a defined objective.

1. Needs Assessment
A planner should conduct a needs assessment for the following reasons:
To define the problem, its extent and severity.
To obtain a profile of the target community, to ascertain the causes of
the problem.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the programme by obtaining baseline
information and comparing with information obtained at a later date.
This is a very costly endeavour. If the funds are not readily available, the
planner may coordinate with the research activities of other agencies
interested in obtaining similar health information on the given population or
investigate surveys that have been done in the past by other organisations.
The information gathered are
:
General information regarding the number of individuals, geographic
distribution, diet, socioeconomic status, ethnic background, public
services available, school systems.
Pattern and distribution of dental disease which can be obtained
through clinical examination records, or consult national health survey
for data.
Current status of dental health programmes being implemented in that
population.
Learn the way policies are developed and decisions are made.
Funds, facilities and labour available.
Preventive dental programme existing in the community like water
fluoridation.
The information so obtained is analysed for the following:
Socioeconomic structure
: It tells whether this population can afford
dental care through their jobs.
Population breakdown
:
 It tells the cultural and language issues that
should be considered.

=== PAGE 703 ===

Age distribution
:
 It tells where the target groups are and thus sets up
certain priorities for planning.
Educational status
:
 It tells the educational level and also what the
community’s values are toward obtaining an education.
Public transport system
:
 A look into the communitiy’s public transport
system gives an idea regarding a population’s ability to get to health
care services.
Health care facilities
:
 It tells the planner what type of services are
being provided, the amount of services and the cost of receiving those
services.
Labour data
:
 It gives us information as to the number of dentists
providing care, and the type of care they are able to provide.
Fluoride status
:
 Fluoride status of a community is also essential for
dental planning.
2. Determining Priorities
Since resources may be limited, priorities are established to allow for the
most efficient allocation. It is used to set priorities among problems and rank
solutions.
If priorities are not determined, the programme may not serve those
individuals or groups who need the care most. Priority is given to:
Those who need care most
Diseases affecting large number of people
High-risk groups.
Once the target group and disease has been identified based on the dental
problem, the type of programme is established.
3. Development of Programme Goals, Objectives and
Activities
Programme goals are broad statements on the overall purpose of a
programme to meet a defined problem. Programme objectives are more
specific and describe in a measurable way the desired end result of
programme activities. It should specify the following:

=== PAGE 704 ===

4.
5.
1.
2.
3.

2.
3.
4.
What is the nature of the situation or condition to be attained?
Extent or magnitude of the situation to be obtained.
For whom is it going to be attained?
Where is it going to be conducted?
The time “at” or “by” which the desired situation or condition is
intended to exist.
For example, by the year 2020, more than 90% of the population aged 6
to 17 years in community X will not have lost any teeth as a result of caries
and at least 40% will be caries-free.
Programme activities
 include the following components:
What is going to be done?
Who will be doing it?
When it will be done?
4. Identification of Resources and Constraints
Resources
The resources to be considered are personnel, equipment and supplies,
facilities and financial resources needed for the programme. Some of the
criteria to determine what resources should be used includes:
Appropriateness
:
 The most suitable resources to get the job done
should be selected.
Adequacy
:
 Refers to the extent or degree to which the resources would
complete the job.
Effectiveness
:
 Refers to how capable the resources are at fulfilling the
objective.
Efficiency
:
 Refers to the cost and the amount of time expended to
complete the job.
Constraints
The most obvious constraints or obstacles to meeting the programme
objectives are determined. By identifying these constraints early in the
planning, one can modify the design of the programme and there by create a

more practical and realistic plan.
1
Constraints that commonly occur in community dental programmes are:
Lack of funding.
Inadequate transportation system.
Labour shortages.
Lack of or inadequate facilities.
Negative community attitudes towards dentistry.
Lack of time, etc.
5. Alternative Strategies
Being aware of the existing constraints and given available resources, it is
important to generate a number of alternate plans so that at least one may be
considered to be acceptable. With limited resources, the planner needs to
consider the anticipated cost and the effectiveness of each alternative.
6–8. Implementation, Supervision, Evaluation and
Revision
Implementation
The process of putting the plan into operation is referred to as the
implementation phase. It involves individuals, organizations and community.
Only through teamwork between the individuals and the environment can the
implementation be successful.
Rules for implementation
Specify clearly the activity (who does what and for whom).
Be sure that someone is responsible for the whole activity.
Identify all the preparatory steps prior to doing the activity (e.g.
prepare training manual, prepare materials, write articles, acquire
equipment, train volunteers, determine treatment protocol).
List steps in the order in which they must occur and check for missing
steps.
Determine when each step should begin and end.

=== PAGE 706 ===
6.
7.
8.
9.
Consult with organizations affected by the activity, identify potential
problems, opportunity, etc.
Specify what resources will be needed and their source.
Specify what constraints will need to be addressed.
Make sure all people involved know what is expected of them and by
when.
Supervision
Once it has been implemented, the programme requires continuous
surveillance of all activities. The programme’s success is determined by
monitoring how well the programme is meeting its stated objectives, how
well individuals are doing their jobs, how well equipment functions, and how
appropriate and adequate facilities are.
Evaluation and revision
Evaluation, both formal and informal, is done in terms of programme
structure, techniques or methods employed and the programme’s impact on
the target disease or population. Before problems arise in any of these areas,
revision must be made to fine tune the programme.

=== PAGE 707 ===
Conclusion
Consumers are more involved than ever before in learning about the types of
health care they should be receiving and are actively questioning the choices
available to them. We must be prepared to meet the challenges of the coming
years through the development of good planning skills, which can then be
used to achieve the necessary goals for the betterment of the community.

=== PAGE 708 ===
SURVEY
Surveys are methods for collection of data, analyzing and evaluating them in
order to determine the amount of disease problems in a community and also
to identify cases that have not been identified. Hence 
survey is defined as
 an
investigation in which information is systematically collected, but in which
experimental method is not used. There is no active intervention.
In short, survey is a 
“non-experimental investigation.”

Advantages
Provide information on some aspects of oral health about which
information may not be available from any other source.
Rates and indices can be calculated.
Associations and correlations can be identified and studied.
Reasons for utilization as well as nonutilization of oral health services
can be studied.
Information from a well-planned systematic survey is more reliable,
complete and accurate compared to information collected routinely.

Basic Oral Health Survey
Basic oral health surveys are defined as surveys to collect the basic
information about oral disease status and treatment needs that is needed for
planning or monitoring oral health care programmes.
3
Special Characteristics of Oral Diseases
4
The diseases are strongly age-related.
One of the dental diseases, dental caries is irreversible and thus
information on current status provides data not only on the amount of
disease present, but also on the previous disease experience.
These common oral diseases exist in all populations, varying only in
intensity and prevalence.
There is extensive documentation on variation of profiles of dental
caries for population groups with different socioeconomic levels and
environmental conditions.
The observations can be recorded on a standard measurement,
facilitating comparison between groups.
Objectives
Initially to provide a full picture of the oral health status and needs of a
population.
Subsequently, to monitor changes in disease levels or patterns.
Stepwise approach (
Fig. 13.3
)
:
4
 It starts with the compilation of key
information on risk factors and self-reported health using questionnaire (Step
1), and then moves on to simple physical measurements (Step 2) followed by
more complex measurements for biochemical analysis (Step 3). It may
include core and extended areas of investigation.

=== PAGE 712 ===
1.
2.
3.
Fig. 13.3:
 Stepwise approach
Steps emphasize that fewer good quality data are more valuable than
large quantities of poor quality data. However, WHO does not recommend
advanced oral health measurements for countries with limited resources.
In this way, it is possible to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness
of services being provided and to plan, or re-plan, oral care services and
training programmes as needed.
Pathfinder Survey
4
It is a practical, economic survey sampling methodology. The method used is
a stratified cluster sampling technique, which aims to include the most
important population subgroups likely to have differing disease levels, and to
cover a standard number of subjects in specific index age groups in any one
location. In this way, statistically significant and clinically relevant
information for planning is obtained at minimum expense.
This methodology is suitable for obtaining the following information:
Prevalence of the various oral diseases affecting the population.
Important variations in disease level, severity and need for
treatment in subgroups of the population.
A picture of the age profiles of oral diseases in the population to

=== PAGE 713 ===
provide information about severity and progression of disease, and
to give an indication as to whether the levels are increasing or
decreasing.
Pathfinder survey is classified as either pilot or national level surveys.
Pilot survey
 is one that includes only the most important subgroups in
the population and only 1 or 2 index ages, usually 12 years and one other age
group. Such a survey provides the minimum amount of data needed to
commence planning. Additional data should then be collected in order to
provide a reliable baseline for the implementation and monitoring of services.
National pathfinder survey
 incorporates sufficient examination sites to
cover allimportant subgroups that may have differing disease levels or
treatment needs and at least three of index ages. This type of survey design is
suitable for the collection of data for the planning and monitoring of services
in all countries regardless of the level of disease, availability of resources or
complexity of care.
Index Age and Age Groups
4
Those recommended are 5 years for primary teeth, 12, 15, 35–44, 65–74
years for permanent teeth. In each age group, minimum of 25–50 subjects is
to be considered.
3
5 years
:
 This age is of interest in relation to levels of caries in the primary
dentition which may exhibit changes over a shorter time span than the
permanent dentition at other index ages.
12 years
:
 This is the age at which children leave primary school, and is also
the last age at which reliable sample may be obtained easily through the
school system. At this age, all permanent molars would have erupted except
the third molars. This age is also chosen as the global monitoring age for
caries for international comparisons and monitoring of disease trends.
15 years
:
 At this age, the permanent teeth have been exposed to the oral
environment for 3 to 9 years. The assessment of caries prevalence is,
therefore, often more meaningful than at 12 years of age. This age is also
important for the assessment of periodontal disease indicators in adolescents.

=== PAGE 714 ===
35 to 44 years
:
 This age group is the standard monitoring group for health
conditions of adults. The full effect of dental caries, the level of periodontal
involvement and the general effects of care provided can be monitored in this
age group.
65 to 74 years
:
 This age group has become more important with the changes
in age distribution and increases in lifespan. Data for this group are needed
both for planning appropriate care for the elderly and for monitoring overall
effects of oral care services.
Number of subjects
:
 The number of subjects in each index age group to
be examined ranges from a minimum of 25 to 50 for each cluster or sampling
site, depending on the expected prevalence and severity of disease.
An example of a sample design for a national pathfinder survey is as
follows:
Urban
: 4 sites in capital city or metropolitan area (4 × 25 = 100)
2 sites in each of 2 large towns (2 × 2 × 25 = 100)
Rural
: 1 site in each of 4 villages in different regions (4 × 25 = 100)
Total for one index age or age group:
12 sites × 25 subjects = 300
Applied to 4 index ages: 4 × 300 = 1200
Considering the number of subjects under each index age group [5, 12,
15, 35 to 44, 65 to 74 years] to be 25,
Total number of subjects inclusive of all index age groups: 5 × 25 = 125
Total sample size from all 8 sites:
125 × 8 = 1000

Steps in Survey
Establishing the objective.
Designing the investigation.
Selecting the sample.
Conducting the examinations.
Analyzing the data.
Drawing the conclusions.
Publishing the reports.
1. Establishing the Objective
The design of the investigation entirely depends on the objectives. Hence, the
objective may be stated by describing what is to be measured, to determine
the resources necessary to provide a service, etc. depending upon the type of
investigation.
2. Designing the Investigation
Types of survey
:
 Surveys may be descriptive or analytical,which are
further subdivided into prevalence or incidence studies.
Prevalence studies
 are commonly used for making comparisons
between two or more populations, or between the same populations at
different times. 
Incidence studies
 are used, where the amount of new
disease in a population is measured over a period of time. The
incidence study is concerned with events, which happen during the
investigation.
Controls
:
 When an investigation is to be carried out to know the
possible effects of a factor it is not enough to confine the examination

=== PAGE 716 ===
c.
a.
b.
c.
to the group exposed to the factor under scrutiny. A parallel group not
exposed must also be studied which is called the control group. Control
group must be as similar as possible to the test group except in respect
of the factor under investigation. The control group is necessary in
order to establish a cause and effect relationship.
Method of study
:
 It could be case control study or cohort study. In the
case control study, the starting point is a group with the disease under
investigation. Assessment is made of the factors which have influenced
these subjects in the past and which might be associated with the
disease, and the findings are compared with those from a suitable
control. Cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic
on experience within a defined time period. During a follow-up period,
assessment is made of the influence that these factors may have on the
occurrence of the disease.
3. Selecting the Sample
When designing a study it is usually impossible to examine every individual
in the population under investigation. Resources in terms of time, money and
manpower are not available for the collection and analysis of such vast
amounts of data. For this reason, it is often decided to study only a part, or
sample, of the study population. Sample is a group of individuals who are
actually available for the investigation. The sample is selected using one of
the sampling designs, which may be simple random sampling, systematic
random sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster sampling, or
multiphase sampling.
4. Conducting the Examinations
The following are to be considered while conducting a survey:
Obtaining approval from the authorities
:
 Permission to examine
population groups must be obtained from a local, regional or national
authority. In case of school children, permission must be obtained from
the school authority.
Budgeting
:
 A budget should be prepared, which should include all the
resources required, including personnel to carry out the survey.
Scheduling
:
 Basic oral health examination of child takes 5 to 10

minutes and for adult it takes 15 to 20 minutes. Using this as the guide,
daily and weekly schedules can then be prepared and handed over to
the survey personnel, school as well as health authorities.
Emergency care and referral
:
 A list of referral facilities and addresses
should be prepared before the survey so that the emergency conditions
can be referred to appropriate care.
Standardization and calibration
:
 To ensure uniform interpretation,
understanding and application by all examiners of the codes and
criteria and to ensure that each examiner can examine consistently, it is
essential to train and calibrate them. Furthermore, the diagnostic
method choosen should be both valid and reliable.
The following precautions are usually taken:
Keep the number of examiners to a minimum.
Discuss interpretation of borderline problems carefully in
advance.
Use only one make and design of explorer.
Divergences of opinion or of observation can be discussed and
minimized.
Circulate among examiners any rules or systems which may
seem pertinent.
Conduct duplicate examination of 5–10% of the samples.
Estimate reproducibility of recordings using Kappa statistics.
Personnel and organization
:
Recording clerk
: The recording clerk is one who is able to
follow the instructions exactly and to print numbers and letters
clearly as instructed by the examiner.
Organising clerk
:
 The organising clerk helps to maintain a
constant flow of subjects and to enter general descriptive
information on the recorded forms. He is also responsible for the
adequate supply of sterile instruments.
Instruments and supplies
:
Plane mouth mirrors—30 per examiner
Periodontal probes—30 per examiner

=== PAGE 718 ===

Several pair of tweezers
Containers and concentrated sterilizing solution
A washbasin
Cloth or paper hand towels
Gauze.
Infection control
:
 All the personnel participating in the survey must be
made aware of the possibility of cross-infection when conducting
examinations or handling contaminated instruments. Current national
standards should be followed for both infection control and waste
disposal.
Examination area
:
 The area for conducting examinations should be
planned and arranged for maximum efficiency and ease of operation.
The most comfortable situation is for the subject to be on a table or a
bench, and the examiner to sit behind the subject’s head. If possible,
natural light should be used at all locations. If not, electricity or
battery-operated lights can be used. The recording clerk must be seated
close to the examiner for instructions and codes to be easily heard.
Crowding and noise must be avoided.
Methods of examination
, criteria for diagnosis and indices to be used
are established. A classification of examination types suggested by the
American Dental Association (1970) is as follows:
Type 1:
 Complete examination: Involves a very complete examination
using mouth mirror and explorer, good illumination, full mouth
radiographs, and such additional diagnostic methods, as study models,
pulp testing, transillumination and laboratory investigation. Used in
intensive clinical studies of special groups.
Type 2:
 Limited examination: This is more limited examination, using
mirror and explorer, good illumination, bitewing and or periapical
radiographs.
Type 3:
 Inspection: This is done using a mirror and explorer under
good illumination.
Type 4:
 Screening procedure: In this, only tongue depressor is used
with available illumination.
Courtesy reporting
:
 Survey findings should be reported to local

=== PAGE 719 ===

authorities. A simple summary of the total number of people examined
and general observations can be reported.
5. Analyzing the Data
If the methods recommended in the WHO manual are followed, computer
analysis of collected data can be done. If a different proforma is used,
analysis is to be done according to preset methods. Different tables and
graphical presentation of data enable meaningful conclusions to be drawn.
6. Drawing the Conclusion
Care must be taken that the conclusions are specifically related to the
investigation that has been carried out and that no extrapolation is made to
the population as whole unless the investigation was designed accordingly.
7. Publishing the Reports
The report of the survey should contain the following information:
Statements and purposes of the survey
:
 Include a brief and clear
description of the aims of the survey.
Materials and methods
:
 Include area and population surveyed,
sampling method, statistical analysis and reliability and reproducibility
of the results.
Results
:
 A few diagrams, graphs, histograms, bar charts or pie charts
may be used to illustrate points.
Discussion and conclusions
:
 The results should be compared with the
data from the previous surveys of the same population or with the
results of surveys in similar or neighbouring population.
Summary or abstract
:
 A brief overview of the objectives,
methodology and conclusion is given. Any unusual or unexpected
results obtained should be noted.

=== PAGE 720 ===
Surveys and Surveillance
4
Surveillance provides an on going, continuous or periodic, collection,
analysis and interpretation of population health data and the timely
dissemination of such data to users.
Properly conducted surveillance ensures that public health administrators
have the information they need to control diseases now or to plan strategies in
the future. In this way, emerging disease patterns and trends can be observed
and evaluated.
Oral health surveillance can be successfully incorporated into national
health surveillance schemes as measurement of just a few crucial indicators,
e.g. percentage of adults with access to primary oral health care services. For
effective surveillance, WHO suggests that clinical oral health surveys should
be conducted regularly every 5 to 6 years in the same community or setting.

=== PAGE 721 ===
Conclusion
Surveying is far more than collecting and arranging of facts. It is a task
through participation in which many key people in a community become
aware of the dental needs of the community and what can be done about
them. They also lay foundation for ensuring programmes.

=== PAGE 722 ===
EVALUATION
Evaluation is the judgement of merit or worth about a particular person, place
or thing. In the context of community activities, 
evaluation
 is the collection
and analysis of information to determine the programme performance.

=== PAGE 723 ===

Purpose of Evaluation
To find out how well the programme works, i.e. to measure its success.
To provide information for decision making.
To measure the effect.
If there is a lack of success then modifications are to be done to
improve the programme.

Criteria
For evaluation of dental services (given by WHO)
Effectiveness
:
 Have the stated objectives been achieved?
Efficiency
:
 What has been the cost in manpower or finance in relation
to the output of the programme?
Appropriateness
:
 Is the programme acceptable to both the consumers
and providers and do the priorities reflect a proper interpretation of the
needs of the population?
Adequacy
:
 Has the intended coverage of the target population been
achieved and are the services readily available?

=== PAGE 725 ===

2.
Types of Evaluation
According to Scriven, the two types are:
Formative evaluation
Summative evaluation
Formative evaluation
:
 It is an examination of the process or activities of
a programme 
as they are taking place
. It is usually carried out to aid in the
development of a programme in its early phases. For example, a fluoride
rinse programme is initiated at a neighbourhood in which paraprofessionals
are trained to administer three types of fluoride rinses. After three days of
operation, the work of the para-professionals is observed to determine the
extent to which the sequence is being maintained.
5
If the sequence is incorrect formative evaluation allows the programme to
make remedial changes at that point and thereby improve performance.
It is used by programme developers to ascertain whether various
components of a programme are workable or whether changes should be
made to improve programme activities.
Summative evaluation
:
 Summative evaluation judges the merit or worth
of a programme 
after it has been in operation
. It is an attempt to determine
whether a fully operational programme is meeting the goals for which it was
developed. Summative evaluation is aimed at programme decision makers,
who will decide whether to continue or terminate a programme.

Elements of Evaluation
Relevance
:
 It relates to the appropriateness of the service, whether it is
needed at all. If there is no need, the service can hardly be of any value.
For example, vaccination against smallpox is irrelevant because the
disease no longer exist.
Adequacy
:
 It implies that sufficient attention has been paid to certain
previously determined course of action. For example, if staff allocation
is such that targets can be achieved without work overload.
Accessibility
:
 It implies whether the patient can reach you easily. The
barriers of accessibility may be physical (distance, travel, time).
Economic (travel cost, free charged) social and cultural (caste or
language barrier).
Acceptability
:
 The patient has to accept the programme.
Effectiveness
:
 It is a measure to determine, if the objectives have been
achieved.
Efficiency
:
 It is a measure of how well resources (money, manpower,
material and time) are utilized to achieve a given outcome.
Impact
:
 It is an expression of long-term outcome of the programme.
For example, if the number of children who brush their teeth twice a
day has increased after a session of health education, the programme is
considered impactful.

Basic Steps in Evaluation
Determine what is to be evaluated
:
Evaluation of the structure
: This is evaluation of whether
facilities, equipment, manpower and organisation meet the
standards.
Evaluation of the process
: The process of dental care includes
the problems of recognition, diagnostic procedures, treatment
and clinical management, care and prevention. The way in
which the activities of the programme is carried out is evaluated
by comparing with predetermined standard.
Evaluation of outcome
: This is concerned with end results of a
programme. The end results should improve dental health in a
community.
Establishment of standard and criteria
:
 Standards and criteria must be
developed in accordance with the focus of evaluation.
Structural criteria
: For example, physical facilities and
equipment.
Process criteria
: For example, every prenatal mother must
receive 6 checkups.
Outcome criteria
: For example, alteration in patient’s health
status.
Planning the methodology
:
 The methodology of evaluation in terms of
criteria and standards against which the current programme is to be
evaluated are established.
Gathering information
:
 Evaluation requires collection of data. The
types of information may include, political, cultural, economic,
environmental and administrative factors. The above factors influence
the health situation as well as the morbidity and mortality statistics.
Analysis of results
:
 Once information has been gathered, the analysis
and interpretation of data should take place within the shortest time.
Then opportunities should be provided for discussing evaluation
results.
Taking action
:
 Based on the outcome of the evaluation, shifting

=== PAGE 728 ===

4.
priorities, revising objectives, or development of new programmes or
services to meet previously unidentified needs may be implemented.
Revaluation
:
 Evaluation is an on-going process and may be repeated,
if required.
Evaluation of quality of dental care programmes
:
 Schonfeld suggested four
levels of evaluation.
2
Evaluate the individual restoration, procedure or service.
Evaluate the mouth that is the relationship of one dental procedure to
another.
Consider the patient’s total oral health and the influence that dental
care has had on the attitude toward dentistry and on dentally related
behaviour.
A look at the family and community, evaluate the dental services
provided for groups and communities and determine the number of and
social distribution of persons receiving adequate dental care.

CHAPTER
14
Dental Auxiliaries
Social forces are the principal determinants of the structure and process of
health services. The types of dental personnel in a society are a part of the
structure: Their number and distribution are part of the process. The concept
of the dental team encompasses the various providers of dental care who have
different roles, functions and periods of training and who combine to treat
patients.
With increasing health consciousness the demand for dental care
increases among the public. There was a necessity to make it affordable and
available to all. In order to provide cost effective services and satisfy demand,
the dedication of some responsibility to suitably trained para-professionals
became inescapable in the dental field. These new para-professionals receive
a less rigorous training of a shorter duration compared to the dentist. They
were expected to perform well demarcated tasks efficiently. Dental auxiliary
is a generic term for all persons who assist the dentist in treating the patients.
In Britain, they have been known as “dental ancillaries”.

=== PAGE 731 ===
Definition
A dental auxiliary or ancillary is a person who is given responsibility by a
dentist so that he or she can help the dentist render dental care, but who is not
himself or herself qualified with a dental degree.

1. Dental Surgery Assistant
The employment of women as dental assistants was started in the USA more
than a century ago. Dr C Edmund Kells of New Orleans employed a woman
as a “lady in attendance” in 1885, so that unaccompanied female patients
could come to his clinic. This practice became popular.
4
 The assistants
started helping the dentist in his business office as well as by chair. The
utilisation improved during World War II due to acute shortage of
professionals to meet the demands of the armed forces. The dental assistants
now assist the dentist in performing certain tasks which are non-technical in
nature and do not require any or much training. The dentist thus can
concentrate and devote full attention to care of patient. In fact, at many places
including India, the assistant gets on-the-job training from the dentist he
serves.
The duties of the dental surgery assistants are as follows:
Reception of the patient.
Preparation of the patient for any treatment he or she may need.
Preparation and provision of all necessary facilities such as
mouthwashes and napkins.
Sterilization care and preparation of instruments.

and impression materials.
Care of the patient after treatment until he or she leaves, including
clearing away of instruments and preparation of instruments for reuse.
Preparation of the surgery for next patient.
Presentation of documents to the surgeon for his completion and filing
of these.
Assistance with X-ray work and the processing and mounting of X-
rays.
Instruction of the patient, where necessary, in the correct use of the
toothbrush.
After care of persons who have had general anaesthetic.
2. Dental Secretary/Receptionist
This is a person who assists the dentist with his secretarial work and patient
reception duties.
3. Dental Laboratory Technician
A non-operating auxiliary who fulfills the prescriptions provided by dentists
regarding the extra oral construction and repair of oral appliances and bridge-
work.
This category of personnel have also been known as dental mechanics.
The functions of dental technician in addition to the casting of models from
impression made by dentists, include the fabrication of dentures, splints,
orthodontic appliances, inlays, crowns and special trays.
Denturist is a term applied to those dental lab technicians who are
permitted in some states in the US and elsewhere to fabricate dentures
directly for patients without a dentist’s prescription. They may be licensed or
registered.
The desire for autonomy among dental laboratory technicians has led to
the formation of “denturists”. Their craft is called ‘denturism’. That is, if the
patient is in need of a denture, the process of fabricating a denture, from the
impression onwards, is done by the technician in direct relationship with the

=== PAGE 735 ===
patient.
2
Several countries have allowed laboratory technicians to work directly
with the public. Tasmania, a state in Australia, was the first place where
technicians were legally permitted to provide a prosthetic service. Denmark
uses the term ‘Denturist’ to describe a special category of dental technician
who sits at an examination, to enable him to prescribe, make and fit
removable dentures without supervision. In the state of Maine, denturists are
permitted to make impressions and fit dentures but only under the direction
of a dentist.
The ADA has vigorously opposed the denturists movement at the
political level. The Association’s principal argument is that denturists are
unqualified to treat patients and the poor-quality care and even actual harm
could result to patients.
5
4. The Dental Health Educator
This is a person who instructs in the prevention of dental disease and who
may also be permitted to apply preventive agents intraorally.
In a few countries, the duties of some dental surgery assistants have been
extended to allow them to carry out certain preventive procedures. In
Sweden, two additional weeks of training are given, after which ancillaries
are allowed to conduct fluoride mouthrinsing programmes to groups of
schoolchildren. They are, however, not allowed to undertake any intraoral
procedures.
5. School Dental Nurse
School dental nurse is a person who is permitted to diagnose dental disease
and to plan and carry out certain specified preventive and treatment measure,
including some operative procedures in the treatment of dental caries and
periodontal disease in defined groups of people, usually schoolchildren.
Interest to improve dental conditions among children in New Zealand
became evident in 1905. Treatment of children was particularly difficult on
account of the distance which often separated small communities. The Dental
Nurse Scheme was established in Wellington, New Zealand in 1921 due to
extensive dental diseases found in army recruits during World War 1914–

1918. The man who influenced its formation was TA. Hunter, a pioneer in
the establishment of a dental school in New Zealand. The name of the school
was ‘the dominion training school for dental nurses’. The training was for a
period of two years to cover both reversible and irreversible procedures.
Upon completion of training, each school dental nurse is assigned to a
school where she is employed by the government to provide regular dental
care of between 450 and 700 children.
School dental nurse is accepted as a member of the school. They are
expected to provide care for the children at nearly 6-month intervals. They
are under general supervision of a district principal dental officer.
The duties of the school dental nurses as listed by the New Zealand
Department of Health Division includes:
Oral examination.
Prophylaxis.
Topical fluoride application.
Advice on dietary fluoride supplements.
Administration of local anaesthesia.
Cavity preparation and placement of amalgam filling in primary and
permanent teeth.
Pulp capping.
Extraction of primary teeth.
Individual patient instruction in tooth brushing and oral hygiene.
Classroom and parent – teacher dental health education.
Referral of patient to private practitioners for more complex services,
such as extraction of permanent teeth, restoration of fractured
permanent incisors and orthodontic treatment.
6. The Dental Therapist
This is a person who is permitted to carry out to the prescription of a
supervising dentist, certain specified preventive and treatment measures
including the preparation of cavities and restoration of teeth.

 In the United
Kingdom, they came into being because of a shortage of dentists to work in
the school dental service. They are likened to New Zealand type school

dental nurse but, they are not permitted to diagnose and plan dental care. The
operative procedures they are entitled to carry out are similar to those of the
New Zealand school dental nurses, including the administration of local
infiltration analgesia.
The training of dental therapists is for about a period of two years
involving both the reversible and irreversible procedures. The functions of a
therapist vary. Their training includes clinical caries diagnosis, technique of
cavity preparation in deciduous and permanent teeth, material handling and
restorative skills, vital pulpotomies under rubber dam in deciduous teeth and
extraction of deciduous teeth under local anaesthesia. They have a little
training in interpretation of X-rays. They are not trained to provide enodontic
care. The dental therapists are widely used in the public dental service.
Apart from Australia and the United Kingdom, other countries using the
services of therapists include Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and
Tanzania.

7. Dental Hygienist
Earlier, the Ohio college of dental surgery had developed a program for
hygienists and assistants in 1910, but it had to be discontinued due to
pressure from the dentists. The duration of training is 1–2 years.
As per the Indian Dentist Act of 1948, a dental hygienist means a person
not being a dentist or a medical practitioner, who scales, cleans or polishes
teeth, or gives instructions in dental hygiene.
A dental hygienist is an operating auxiliary licensed and registered to
practice dental hygiene under the laws of the appropriate state, province,
territory or nation. The dental hygienists work under the supervision of
dentists.
The usual functions of dental hygienists are:
Cleaning of mouths and teeth with particular attention to calculus and
stains.
Topical application of fluorides, sealants, and other prophylactic
solutions.
Screening or preliminary examination of patients as individuals or in

group (school children or industrial employees) so that they may be
referred to dentists for treatment.
Instruction in oral hygiene.
Resource work in the field of dental health.
8. Expanded Functions Dental Auxiliary
They have been referred to as expanded function dental assistant, expanded
function dental hygienist, expanded function auxiliary, technotherapist,
expanded duty dental auxiliary.
EFDA is a dental assistant, or a dental hygienist in some cases, who has
received further training in duties related to the direct treatment of patients,
though still working under direct supervision of a dentist. They are allowed to
carry out reversible procedures that is which could be either corrected or
redone without undue harm to the patient’s health. They do not prepare
cavities or make decision as to pulp protection after caries has been
excavated, but work alongside the dentist and take over routine restorative
procedures, as soon as the cavity preparation and base have been completed.

In 1958, WHO introduced two new types of auxiliaries.
1. 
Dental Licentiate
:
 He is a semiindependent operator trained for 2
years. Their dental knowledge and skill are equivalent to New Zealand dental
nurse. They work under a wider variety of conditions and for all age. Their
functions include dental prophylaxis, cavity preparation and fillings of
primary and permanent teeth, extraction under local anaesthesia, drainage of
dental abscesses, treatment of prevalent diseases of supporting tissues, early
recognition of serious conditions.
They are responsible to the chief of the regional or local health service.
Their service would probably occur in rural or frontier areas and so,
supervision and control would probably be remote.
2. 
Dental aide
:
 Among native populations the dental aides provide
elementary first aid procedures for the relief of pain, including extraction of
teeth under local anesthesia, control of haemorrhage, recognition of dental
disease.
They would operate only within a salaried health organization and be
under supervision, the closer the better, particularly at first. The formal
training extends from 4 to 6 months, followed by a period of field training
under direct and constant supervision.
Frontier auxiliaries
:
 They include capable lay people, in particular
nurses and former dental assistants with minimum training. Their functions
include dental prophylaxis, dental health education, relief of pain, referral,
fluoride rinse program, simple denture repairs.
Future developments
:
 Predicting the future is a thankless task at best,
and the task of attempting to predict future developments in dental care is
more thankless than most. Rate of population growth, types of healthcare
systems that evolve, economic developments, consumers demands, and
legislative action will all be major factors in shaping the future of the dental
care system. Within dentistry, the growth of specialists, the ability to increase
productivity in the dental office, and the apparent growing restlessness of
auxiliary groups will all exert their influences. The demands of society mean
that the cherished autonomy of the dental profession may be curtailed to
some extent.

School Dental Health
It is well recognized that the children of today are the citizens of tomorrow.
The prosperity of a nation depends upon the health of its future citizens.
School health is an important aspect of any community health
programme. The school health programme is a powerful, yet economical
approach towards raising the level of community health. Its basic aim is to
provide a comprehensive healthcare programme for children of school going
age.
The school age is a formative period, physically as well as mentally,
transforming the schoolchild into a promising adult. Health habits formed at
this stage will be carried to the adult age, old age and to the next generation.
Thus a school dental health service is a giant leap for the improvement of the
nation.

Aims of School Dental Service
To help every schoolchild appreciate the importance of a healthy
mouth.
To help every schoolchild appreciate the relationship of dental health,
general health and appearance.
To encourage the observance of dental health practices, including
personal care, professional care, proper diet and oral habits.
To correlate dental health activities with the total school health
programme.
To stimulate the development of resources to make dental care
available to all children and youths.
To stimulate dentists to perform adequate health services for children.

Peep into the Past
No authentic records are available in India regarding initiation of school
health services. Way back in 1909 medical examination of schoolchildren is
reported to have been carried out in Baroda city for the first time in India. In
1946, Bhore committee noted that school health services were non-existent in
India.
In 1960, Government of India constituted a school health committee to
assess the standards of health and nutrition and also assigned the task of
suggesting ways and means to improve the health status of school going
children.
In 1961, the committee submitted its report, which contained many useful
suggestions and recommendations.
In view of the crucial importance of school health, the Government of
India constituted a task force to propose an intensive school health service
project. The task force submitted its report in 1982 and identified the
following reasons for the poor state of school health programme.
Lack of transport facilities for the primary healthcare medical officer.
Lack of budget for printing health cards, etc.
Lack of properly trained schoolteachers, multipurpose workers and
other education and health personnel who can ensure effective
functioning of the school health programme.
Lack of proper documentation and evaluation.
Lack of co-ordination between
Different schemes and health programmes within the health
department.
Health department and outside agencies particularly the
education department.
The task force then suggested an intensive pilot project fully sponsored
by the central government. It was started in 25 blocks from remote and
underdeveloped areas of different states in 1982–83. Then in 1984–85 it was
extended to 75 more blocks.
The central government’s school health project is a step in the right

=== PAGE 744 ===
direction, but it suffers from the major drawback that it is essentially a project
of the health department, there being very little coordination with the
education department.

Healthy Environment
This should include not only the sanitation of the school premises but also the
surroundings, which have moral, physical and mental effect on the
schoolchildren. The site and maintenance of school building is important.
2
The medical officer should advice the school authorities on different items of
sanitation such as
Water supply
Drainage
Urinals
Latrines
Refuse
Ventilation
Playground.

Health Education
This is the most important element of a school health programme. It does not
merely imply inclusion of health lessons in the textbooks but also includes
the following.
Insisting on high standards of cleanliness.
Introducing healthy practices in the diet.
Demonstrating personal hygiene like tooth-brushing, cutting nails,
dressing of hair. The teacher plays a very vital role in all elements of
the school health programme especially in health education.
Personnel involved in Dental Education
The dentist
Dental hygienist
Dental therapist
Health educator
Classroom teacher
The teaching of oral hygiene is and must be a primary responsibility of
the classroom teacher. The teacher’s interest in securing dental corrections is
a major factor in developing pupil’s interest and action. Teachers properly
instructed in the principles of oral hygiene and gifted with enthusiasm and
persistence can stimulate children to seek dental service.
2
Other Personal
The science teacher should be supplied with facts on dental
development and dental diseases.
The physical education teacher must know how to prevent accidents to
teeth.
The nutritionist should be in a position to help put dietary
recommendations into action.
The guidance counselor in a secondary school can assist in personal
health counseling.

Dental health education, like education on any other subject, depends on
the child’s ability to learn and his stage of development.
Kasey suggests some examples of age specific dental subject materials.
2
Kindergarten
First grade
Brushing the teeth.
Rinsing the mouth.
Second grade to fourth grade
Teach the importance of preservation of the teeth through proper care.
Teach the importance of visit to the dentist and keeping teeth clean.
Fifth grade to sixth grade
Teach the importance of good dental health to overall physical health.
Junior high
This is the scientific age and the beginning of interest in appearance.
Emphasis can be made on
Chemical aspects of tooth formation.
Importance of preventive measures.
Dental healthcare.
Prevention of periodontal disease.
Senior high
Stress the importance of
Making decisions.
Scientific causes of dental diseases including periodontal disease, oral
cancer and preventive measures.
Problems of Dental Education in Schools
According to Kennedy there are four prime reasons.

=== PAGE 749 ===
1.

3.
4.
Decision makers for preschool programmes are not aware of need and
effectiveness of preventive dentistry practice that can be accomplished
within a school environment.
Parents and community leaders are not committed to oral health.
Public health officials have not demonstrated aggressive leadership in
establishing meaningful school oral health programme.
Individual dentist show a little support of school health programmes.

=== PAGE 750 ===
Healthcare Services
It should be promotive, protective and curative as well as rehabilitative.
Initial care and maintenance care is together called comprehensive dental
care.

=== PAGE 751 ===

COMPREHENSIVE DENTAL CARE
Definition
It is defined as the meeting of accumulated dental needs at the time a
population group is taken into the programmes and the detection and
correction of new increments of dental disease on a semi-annual or other
periodic basis.
2
Advantages
Less money spend on permanent teeth
Interruptions are less
Psychologically better
Usually self-motivated teenagers are treated here, so it is psychologically
better as they are in need for the treatment and because of the same reason
they avoid interruption to treatment.
Disadvantages
Disease has already occurred
Initial cost of controlling the disease is more
More dental man-hours required
A strong emphasis on preventive dentistry programmes would reduce the
learning time lost in going and coming from a treatment facility as well as
actual operative time. In comprehensive care we not only think in terms of
eliminating pain and infection but in terms of restoration of serviceable tooth
to good functional form, replacement of missing teeth, maintenance care for
control of early lesion of dental disease and also preventive and educational
measures so that the population may experience a lower prevalence of
disease.

Comprehensive Health Service Criteria
Provision of adequate preventive, curative and promotive health
service.
To be as close to the beneficiaries as possible.
To have the widest co-operation between the people, the service and
the profession.
To be available for all irrespective of their ability to pay for it.
To look after more specifically the vulnerable and weaker section of
the community.
To create and maintain a healthy environment both in home and
working places. Such a care needs to be complete, competent,
continuous, co-ordinate compassionate and for the community.

=== PAGE 753 ===
INCREMENTAL DENTAL CARE
It is defined as a periodic care so spaced that increments of dental diseases
are treated at the earliest time, consistent with proper diagnosis and operating
efficiency in such a way that there is no accumulation of dental needs.
2
In schoolchildren incremental dental care represents ideal pattern for the
care and appreciable incidence of new dental disease is to be expected each
year.
In private practice 6 months is the commonest, though not the only
interval between the visits. In public health programmes one-year interval is
usually employed.

Aim
It is basically a rational approach on annual basis to the dental problems and
a plan for life long dental care.
Advantages
Aims at prevention and maintenance as the programme starts at an
early age. It provides a complete oral examination during early
childhood.
Initial cost is less.
Man-hours for initial care is less.
Early lesions of dental caries are treated before the involvement of
pulp.
Topical and other preventive measures can be maintained on a periodic
basis.
Periodontal disease is interrupted at/near beginning.
Bills for services are equalized and regularly spaced.
Child develops the habit of visiting the dentist periodically.
The programme helps the community to obtain a favourable impression
on the dentist.
Disadvantages
Time consuming, e.g. multiple fillings.
Psychologic
:
 Young people develop their own habits, so habits learned
in childhood would not necessarily be carried to adulthood.
There is exhaustion of financial resources as it is a long and periodic
programme.
Interruptions in dental healthcare programme may occur due to
migration.
Dunning has pointed out that there are several advantages to a school-based
programme.
The children are available for preventive or treatment procedures.

=== PAGE 755 ===
2.

4.
School clinics are less threatening than private offices.
A school dental programme facilitates central education on dental
subjects.
The dental service supplements, the nursing services by helping to
provide total health care for schoolchildren.

=== PAGE 756 ===
Student Participation in School Programme
Programmes devoted to schoolchildren have been particularly popular
because children have been highly susceptible to dental caries. Many children
especially those with the highest disease levels whose families may not be
able (or) interested in providing for their oral health needs, do not visit dental
offices. Yet virtually all of them attend school and therefore, would be
exposed to a school-based programme.
3
In developing countries like India such care for participation implies
awareness and acceptance of modern concepts in health and sickness and it
involves a change in traditional pattern of living and availability of basic
sanitary amenities.
Philosophically all children should be entitled to receive maximum
primary preventive dental care that includes the use of fluorides, pit and
fissure sealants, reduced sugar consumption, plaque control and education.

How to Start a School Health Programme?
Organize the principals of schools.
Motivate and involve the teachers.
Provide health education to teachers.
Develop resource materials and child-to-child activities.
Implement the programme. It is essential to form a coordinating health
committee for this purpose, consisting of the principal, teachers,
community leaders, parents and children.

SCHOOL DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMES
1
1. Askov Dental Health Education
It is a classical example of a school dental health programme.
Askov is a small farming community in Minnesota. It showed very high
dental caries in the initial survey made in 1943 and 1946. During 1949–1957,
Minnesota health department supervised a demonstration school dental health
programme in Askov including caries prevention and control, dental health
education and dental care. All recognized methods for preventing dental
caries were used in the demonstration with the exception of communal water
fluoridation.
Dental findings are available through a 10-year period, which includes:
28% reduction in dental caries in deciduous teeth of 3–5 years old.
34% reduction in caries in permanent teeth of children 6–12 years old.
14% reduction in children 13–14 years old.
The cost of the programme was greater and the caries reduction was
smaller than are now occurring with water fluoridation in the same
community.
But fluoridation is by no means a substitute for such a programme. Good
health habits are valuable even for persons with resistant teeth, and dental
care for the indigent is still needed in the fluoridated areas.

=== PAGE 759 ===
2. School Dental Health Nurse Programme
The New Zealand School Dental Nurse Plan was introduced in the year 1921.
When the service began, care was offered only to younger school-age
children, but eligibility now extends to all children in primary and
intermediate school (2 V to 13 V) years of age.
The New Zealand school dental nurse plan has attracted tremendous
attention in dental circles all over the world. Other countries that have
adopted similar programmes, with modifications to suit the local government
include Canada, Britain, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Hong Kong
and Indonesia.
In Canada, Saskatchewan dental nurse programme was introduced in
1974, where children aged 3–12 years are to be treated by dental nurses and
services provided are free of direct charge.
In Britain, “New Cross” dental nurse model was introduced in 1962 for
school dental service. They also started child-to-child health programme.
Several Australian States have now started wide dental plans in which
direct patient care for children up to 15 years of age is provided by dental
therapists.

SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAMMES IN INDIA
Dental health is a part of general health in programmes run by certain
voluntary association of India. They conduct teacher training
programmes in which a dental health is a part of total health
curriculum.
Voluntary agencies like the Lions, Rotary and others conduct school
dental health programme.
Colgate’s Bright Smiles, Bright Futures Education Programme (BSBF)
—Bright Smiles, Bright Future (BSBF) is committed to educating
children about oral healthcare. The aim is to spread awareness among
children about the correct oral health habits, basic hygiene and diet,
using engaging aids to ensure they retain the learning.
Indian Dental Association launches ‘Smile Through The Millennium’
National Oral Health Programme—A key element of the Programme is
the ‘Oral Health Week’ which will be conducted for both the general
public as well as school children across the country it will include free
dental check-ups, dental health exhibitions, brushing demonstrations as
well as contests for children like the Beautiful Smile Contest, Collage
Competitions, Painting Competitions and Elocution Contests.
India Smiles campaign: India Smiles campaign, a joint initiative of
Saveetha University and Times of India, to create awareness on the
importance of oral hygiene and dental healthcare among the children,
their parents and teachers. The children were given pamphlets on
maintaining oral health and various types of treatment were suggested.
A total of 1,01,309 schoolchildren were screened for dental problems
in a single day at 77 centres across the country, earning the event an
entry in the Guinness Book of Records

Payment for
Dental Care
Healthcare services traditionally have been provided on a fee for service
basis, whereby the patient receives specific services and pays the provider for
them directly. This two party system is a private contract in which the only
parties involved are the provider and the recipient of services.
Dentistry’s entry into the third party system has been relatively recent,
but third party dental care is now a major and still expanding part of dental
services. As the cost of health care continue to rise, methods will be sought to
ease costs either by legislation or by the development of a variety of funding
approaches.
3
The acceleration in the rate of increase of healthcare costs have been
attributed to a number of factors, principally
The public’s increasing demand for health services.
The ever-growing technology of health care.
The probably higher quality of care now being delivered.
General inflation.
The lack of incentives in medical care to keep costs down.
The increasing practice of “defensive medicine” in which
diagnostic tests and prescribed treatment are aimed at avoiding
lawsuits rather than at meeting the patients real needs.

MECHANISM OF PAYMENT FOR DENTAL CARE
The mechanism by which dental practitioners receive payment for their
services can be grouped into the following general categories.
3
Private fee for service
Post payment plans
Private third party prepayment plans
Commercial insurance companies
Non-profit health service corporations such as delta dental plans
and blue cross/blue shield
Prepaid group practice including health maintenance
organization and independent practice associations
Capitation plans
Salary
Public programmes
Medicare
Medicaid
Veterans administration (VA)
National health insurance (NHI)

=== PAGE 770 ===

1. Private Fee for Service
Private fee for service, the two party arrangement is the traditional form of
reimbursement for dental services in most countries. Although alternative
forms of payment for dental services are growing rapidly, at present the
private fee for service arrangement is still the method by which dental
patients pay for their care.
Advantages
It is culturally acceptable—the concept of the individual establishing a
fee for the service rendered is inherent in the way of doing business.
It is flexible-fees can be charged in accordance with the market
conditions.
It is administratively simple.
Disadvantages
In spite of its advantages there are still some potential patients who simply
cannot afford the dental care offered. These persons would thus be unable to
receive dental care if private fee for service were the only financing
mechanism for dental care.

=== PAGE 771 ===
2. Postpayment Plans
It was first introduced in the late 1930’s by local dental societies in
Pennsylvania and Michigan. It is also known as budget payment plans.
Under a budget payment plan the patient borrows money from a bank or
finance company to pay the dentist fee at the time that the agreement to
receive care is made. After the application is approved by the lending
institution, the dentist is paid the entire fees less a discount charge. The
patient then repays the loan (with interest of course) to the bank in budgeted
amounts.
It was developed with the intention of providing dental care to large
segments of population, and it was primarily used by people of middle
income rather than the low income. It was also primarily to finance for
prosthetic treatment. Given the current trend of the widespread use of credit
cards, it is unlikely that postpayment plans will develop any further.

=== PAGE 772 ===
3. Private Third Party Prepayment Plans
Third party payment for dental services is defined as “payment for services
by some agency rather than directly by the beneficiary of those services”. The
dentist and the patient are the first and second parties and the administrator of
finances is the third party. The third party is also known as the carrier,
insurer, underwriter or administrative agent.
Private third party plans are now almost totally prepayment plans. This
form of prepayment is frequently referred to as dental insurance.
Reimbursement of Dentists in Prepayment Plans
The preferred method for reimbursement for dentist in prepayment plans is
3
as follows.
Usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) fee Usual fee
:
 The fee usually
charged for a given service by an individual dentist to private patients—that
is, his or her own usual fee.
Customary fee
:
 A fee is customary when it is in the range of the usual fee
charged by dentist of similar training and experience for the same service
within the specific and limited geographic area.
Reasonable fee
:
 A fee is reasonable if it meets these two criteria.
The evolution of the UCR fee concept as a mechanism acceptable to
dentists and to carriers has allowed third party dental care to be provided
while still permitting the individual dentist to charge what he or she believes
the services are worth.
Table of allowances
A table of allowances is defined as a list of covered services that assigns to
each service a sum that represents the total obligation of the plan with respect
to payment for such service, but that does not necessarily represent a dentist’s
full fee for that service. For example, if a third party plan permits a fee of 
₹
80 for a particular service for which the dentists usual fee is 
₹
 100, the dentist
will carry out the service, pick up 
₹
 80 from the carrier and may charge the

=== PAGE 773 ===
1.
2.
•
•
•
patient 
₹
 20 to make up the usual fee.
The ADA is opposed to:
Capitation
Fee schedules
Capitation
A capitation fee is defined as a fixed monthly or yearly payment paid by a
carrier to a dentist in a closed panel, based on the number of patients assigned
to the dentist for treatment.
The money is paid regardless of whether the patients participate in the
plan, receive no care, a little care or great deal of care.
Fee 
Schedules
A fee schedule is defined as maximum dollar allowances for dental
procedures that apply under a specific contract. The difference is that a fee
schedule is usually taken to mean payment in full, whereas a table of
allowance may not.
a. Commercial Insurance Companies
Many persons have dental insurance from commercial insurance carriers than
they do from any other type of carriers. The fundamental difference between
commercial insurance carriers and others is that commercial insurance
carriers operate for profit.
Commercial insurance companies have become competitive through a
variety of other mechanisms
They can be more selective about the group to which it chooses to
offer dental insurance.
They claim no obligation towards the dental health of the
community.
They sometimes arrange an identity programme, which provides
specific cash payment reimbursement for specified covered
services. These payments can be made directly to the patients or it
can be assigned by the patient to be paid directly to the dentist.

=== PAGE 774 ===

They present attractive total health package to potential purchasers.
Advantages
Many pay the dentist directly for provision of covered services and
hence payment is quicker and hassle free.
They do not conduct fee audits and posttreatment dental examinations
to assess the quality of care delivered.
Disadvantages
They do not encourage utilization of professional services.
In order to allow for the profit margin they need to charge higher
premiums.
b. Non-profit Health Service Corporation
1. 
Delta dental plans
:
 In June 1954, the Seattle district dental society in
Washington state was approached with a request for a comprehensive dental
care programme for children up to 14 years of age. The union was requesting
their employers to add a programme of dental care for their children. It was
clear that a statewide programme was really being requested, so the
Washington States Dental Association soon became involved. Shortly
thereafter, the first dental service corporation was born.
1
A dental service corporation is a legally constituted non-profit
organization incorporated on a state-by-state basis and sponsored by a
constituent dental society to negotiate and administer contracts for dental
care.
As the number of corporations grew and the size of the groups for which
dental care benefits were negotiated grew in size, the need for a national
organization became apparent. Accordingly the National Association of
Dental Service Plans (NADSP) was formed in June 1966. The NADSP
changed its name to delta dental plans association in April 1969.
The majority of the board of directors of most delta plans are dentists who
are elected from a slate approved by the state dental society. Other board
members represent the worlds of finance, insurance, labour and consumer
groups.

Delta plans also have specific approaches to ensure the quality of care
provided and to keep a programme’s costs within its limits. Quality of care is
monitored by a series of post treatment examinations, whereby a sample of
individual patients who have received care through a Delta plan is examined
by a panel of disinterested dentist to ensure that:
1
The care claimed and paid for has in fact been provided.
That it is of “acceptable” quality.
Mechanism of cost control includes coinsurance, preauthorization
procedures for certain treatment and annual limits on specific items of care
that can be expensive, such as orthodontic care. Unlike commercial insurance
companies, they do not run on profit and have an obligation towards the
community since Delta primarily reflects the view of dental professional and
they encourage utilization of services. Delta plans are small in comparison to
the giants of the commercial insurance world but they have managed to grow
to a healthy state and to compete quite successfully. Delta attractiveness as a
carrier rests on
Control of costs.
Quality assurance procedures.
That individual patients know they will not have to pay extra for
their treatment, since participating dentist agree to receive payment
in full from delta.
Wide support from dental practitioners.
Reimbursement of Dentists in Delta Plans
Delta plans use the UCR concept almost exclusively. The way in which a
dentist is reimbursed depends on whether the dentist is participating or non-
participating in the plan. A participating dentist has a contractual agreement
with Delta plan to render care to covered subscribers.
1
Delta plans encourage all dentists to participate. Those who do agree to
the following conditions.
Prefiling of their usual and customary fees.
Acceptance of payment for their services at the 90
th
 percentile of
fees as payment in full, which means they will not assess the patient

=== PAGE 776 ===

for further charges.
Fee audits by auditors from Delta. The purpose is to ensure that the
dentists are charging their Delta plan patients the same fees as they
charge their other patients.
Post-treatment inspection of randomly chosen patients. This is to
ensure that quality care is rendered.
Non-participating dentist can also treat patients covered under Delta plans
and be reimbursed by Delta. They do not need to prefile their fees and are not
subject to fee audits, however, they are paid at a lower percentile than the
90
th
, often at the median, or the 50
th
 percentile.
90
th
 Percentile
The percentiles of a set of data divide the total frequency into hundredths, so
that the 90
th
 percentile is that value below which 90 percent of the
observations lie.
For example, suppose in a given area there are 100 participating dentists
who have filed their fee for a particular service. The fee filed will vary from
one dentist to another. In this instance the fee charged vary from 
₹
 50 to 
₹
150. If each of these fee is spread out in a frequency distribution, from the
lowest to the highest, the result will be as shown in 
Fig. 14.1
.
Only 10 dentists charge 
₹
 50 and 20 of them charge 
₹
 60 and 30 of them
charge 
₹
 70 or less and so on. There are a few dentists who charge
considerably higher for the service. The 95
th
 percentile is 
₹
 140 and the 100
th
percentile is at 
₹
 150. The median fee which is equivalent to the 50
th
percentile would be 
₹
 90. The key point to note is that if payment is made at
the 90
th
 percentile, (
₹
 120) 90 percent of the participating dentists receive
their full fee for the service and only 10 percent of the participating dentists
would be less than their usual fee. Non-participating dentist is paid at the 50
th
percentile.
The rationale behind paying at the 90
th
 percentile is to exclude those
dentists at the top end of the scale who charge fees considerably higher than
the norm of an area. Thus it is cost control mechanism.

Blue cross/blue shield
:
 The health service corporations of which blue

=== PAGE 777 ===
coverage as a part of hospital/surgical/medical policies. They have adopted
many of the cost control features pioneered by delta plans and in some states
it is difficult to distinguish blue cross/blue shield dental plans from delta
dental plans in terms of benefits and administration.
Fig. 16.1:

service
c. Prepaid Group Practice
The term group practice simply means a number of dentists practicing
together under certain organizational arrangements. The definition adopted
by ADA is as follows: “Group practice is that type of dental practice in which
dentists, sometimes in association with the members of other health
professions, agree formally between themselves on certain central
arrangements designed to provide efficient dental health service.”
3
There is no inherent relation between group practice and prepaid care. Net
income in a group practice can be divided equally or prorated according to
patient load, years of service, specialty, etc., whereas majority of patients
who receive care through group practices do so on the usual private patient
fee for service basis. Prepaid group dental practice could move the dental
profession closer to the moral and ethical ideals of dentistry than typical fee
for service can and that the quality of care improves when the dentist does
not have to worry about the patient’s ability to pay.
Advantages

Better ways of organizing one’s life-vacations and continuing
education leaves can be planned more readily.
Less disruption in practice caused by illness to the dentist.
Quality of care is said to be improved.
Financial fringe benefits.
Economies of scale through the sharing of pieces of equipment,
personnel and other resources.
Disadvantages
Personality
: It is essential that dentist in a group be temperamentally
compatible.
Dentist unlike physicians are taught to work independently and this
desire for independence is one reason suggested for the slow growth of
dental group practice.
d. Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO)
An HMO is defined as “a legal entity, which provides a prescribed range of
health services to each individual who has enrolled in the organization in
return for a prepaid, fixed and uniform payment.
3
Dental personnel in HMO
Staff model
: Dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants are
salaried employees of the HMO.
Group model
:
 The HMO contracts directly with a group practice,
partnership or corporation for the provision of dental services.
Direct contract model
:
 The HMO contracts directly with the individual
provider for provision of services.
Independent practice association
It is an association of independent dentists that develops its own management
and fiscal structure for the treatment of patients enrolled in an HMO.
e. Capitation Plans
A capitation fee is defined as a fixed monthly or yearly payment paid by a

=== PAGE 779 ===
carrier to a dentist in a closed panel, based on the number of patients assigned
to the dentist for treatment.
The money is paid regardless of whether the patients utilize care or not.
Closed panel
Closed panel practice exists when a group of dentists who share office
facilities provide stipulated services to an eligible group for a set premium.
For beneficiaries of plans using closed panels, choice of dentist is limited to
panel members, and dentist must accept any beneficiary as a patient.
1
Open panel
Any licensed dentist can participate, the beneficiary has choice from among
all licensed dentists, and the dentist may accept or refuse any beneficiary.

=== PAGE 780 ===
•
•
4. Salary
Dentist in some group practices (especially closed panel clinics), those in the
armed forces and those employed by public agencies are salaried. A new
graduate beginning a career in an established practice may draw a salary for a
temporary period.
Advantages
Dentist will be largely free of the business concerns of running a
practice and thereby allows the dentist to concentrate on clinical
matters.
Fringe benefits are also often attractive.
Disadvantage
: Lack of financial incentives.

=== PAGE 781 ===
PUBLIC PROGRAMMES
Dentistry did not play a significant part in the early development of public
medical care programmes. Oral health was of relatively little concern in a
period when the population was decimated periodically by typhoid,
diphtheria, cholera and smallpox. Although a few public clinics were
established on a voluntary basis by dentists as early as mid 19
th
 century.
Public dental care facilities remained nonexistent for many years. The US
public health service did not employ dentists on a regular basis until 1919.
2
a. Medicare
Title XVIII of the social security amendments of 1965 is the programme
known as Medicare. This programme removed all financial barriers for
hospital and physician services for all persons over age 65, regardless of their
financial means. The expenditure of the programme was considerably higher
than estimated in the first few years of operation. By mid 1970s, it had two
parts:
Part A: Hospital insurance
Part B: Supplemental medical insurance
Both parts contain highly complex series of service benefit available and
both require some payment by the patient. This programme was brought into
being because the voluntary health insurance system was unable to provide
adequately for persons over the age of 65. The dental segment of this
programme is limited to those services requiring hospitalization for their
treatment, usually surgical treatment for fractures and cancer.
b. Medicaid
Title XIX of the social security amendments of 1965 is the programme
known as Medicaid. The original intent of the programme was to provide
funds to meet the healthcare needs of all indigent and medically indigent
persons. Expenditures for the programme grew at a more rapid rate than did
the total expenditures for all healthcare. In order to qualify for the federal
government’s share, the programme must cover at least these basic services.
1

Inpatient hospital care.
Outpatient hospital care.
Laboratory and X-ray services.
Skilled nursing care facilities.
Home health services for individuals aged 21 or older.
In addition it required early and periodic screening, diagnosis and
treatment (EPSDT programme) for individual under 21, family planning
services and physician services. The EPSDT programme was supported by
ADA because for the first time a federal programme mandated dental care for
indigent children.

=== PAGE 783 ===
Conclusion
Private fee for service is likely to remain the predominant method of
financing dental care in the foreseeable future. The developing countries like
India are in a transition period, during which alternative modes of delivery of
services and financing of these services will evolve.
Dental professionals must and will adapt to this changing environment. Our
responsi
bilities will not diminish; instead we must remain involved to ensure the
public of the highest standards of care and professionalism.

Ethical Issues
Dentistry is treated by society as a learned profession, and therefore dental
professionals have a responsibility to society. Society has conferred upon the
professions a special status with unique rights and privileges. It is society’s
belief that professionals place the welfare of the patient above their own
welfare, which helps support the independence of the professions in a
regulated society. This covenant with society requires professionals to
practice in an ethical manner, if society is to continue to accord these special
privileges.

=== PAGE 786 ===
Definition
Ethics is defined as the part of philosophy that deals with moral conduct and
judgement.

PRINCIPLES
There are several principles that healthcare professionals must be aware of in
the practice of their profession. Knowing the names of these principles will
not make us more ethical, but understanding the basis for certain behaviours
may help us make more carefully reasoned decisions when confronted with
ethical dilemmas. The major principles are
1
To do no harm (non-maleficence)
:
 This principle is attributed to
Hippocrates and is considered to be the foundation of social morality.
To do good (beneficence)
:
 It should be the role of dentists and dental
hygienists to benefit patients, as well as not to inflict harm. The
expectation of the patient is that the care provider will initiate
beneficial action and that there is an agreement between the doctor and
the patient that some good will occur.
Autonomy
:
 This principle dictates that healthcare professionals respect
the patient’s right to make decisions concerning the treatment plan.
Patients should not be bystanders in their treatment but active
participants. Informed consent both a legal and an ethical concept, is an
essential component of a patient’s right to autonomy. The following
elements should be present.
Disclosure of appropriate information.
Comprehension of the information by the patient.
Voluntary consent.
Competence to consent.
Justice
:
 It is described as fairness or equal treatment, giving to each his
or her right or due.
Truthfulness
:
 Lying fails to show respect for persons and their
autonomy, violates explicit agreements and threatens relationships
based on trust.
Confidentiality
:
 Patients have the right to expect that all
communications and records pertaining to their care will be treated as
confidential. It is very natural to want to gossip about a patient,
particularly if it is someone famous or possibly a neighbour, but to do

=== PAGE 788 ===
so would break a bond of trust between the dental professional and the
patient. Confi-detiality must be maintained at all times.

Code of Ethics
All professional organizations have a published code to which members of
the profession are expected to adhere. These codes have been developed over
a long period of time, they reflect the customs and beliefs of current members
of the profession and provide a historic link with the past. The Dental
Council of India makes the following regulations for laying down standards
of professional conduct.
Duties and Obligations of Dentists toward Patient and
Public
Every dentist shall be mindful of the high character of his mission and
the responsibilities he holds in the discharge of his professional duties
and shall always remember that care of the patient and treatment of the
disease depends upon the skill and prompt attention shown by him and
always remembering that his personal reputation, professional ability
and fidelity remain his best recommendation.
Treat the welfare of the patient as paramount to all other considerations
and shall conserve it to the utmost of his ability.
Be courteous, sympathetic, friendly and helpful to and always ready to
respond to the call of his patients, and should be polite and dignified.
Observe punctuality in fulfilling his appointment.
Deem it a point of honour to adhere with as much uniformity as the
varying circumstances may admit, to the remuneration for professional
services.
Not permit consideration of religion, nationality, race, caste and creed,
party politics or social standing to intervene in his duties towards his
patients.
Keep all the information of a personal nature which he comes to know
about a patient directly or indirectly in the course of professional
practice in utmost confidence. Dental hygienists and dental mechanics
and other staff employed by him also observe this rule for the reason
that knowledge or information of a patient gained during the course of
examination and treatment is privileged, and a dentist is not bound to

disclose professional secret, except with the consent of the patient, or
on being ordered to do so by a court of law.

professional assistant, not being a registered dental hygienist or a
registered dental mechanic whose name is not registered in the state
dentists register.

Legal Vulnerability in Dental Practice
Legal vulnerability in dental practice may be divided into two broad
categories (
Fig. 17.1
).
1
Criminal
Civil
Fig. 17.1:
 Legal vulnerability in dental practice
a. Criminal
Violations of statutory law are termed crimes. They constitute acts that are
deemed by the government to be against public interest.
The penalties include
:
Loss or suspension of license
Mandatory psychiatric counseling
Drug rehabilitation
Mandatory continuing education

Fines
Jail term
Violations of administrative laws (state board, state education
department) are termed quasi crimes. The penalties include all actions under
crimes except the jail term.
Contract
A contract is defined “as an agreement between parties” and can be either
verbal or written. In law both are equally binding, but as the parties may have
differing recollections of what was said, the advantages of a written
agreement are apparent.
I. Doctor-patient contract
A written treatment plan and charge estimate, which is signed by the patient
puts the legal foundation of doctor-patient relationship.
Duties owed by the doctor
Use reasonable care in the provision of services as measured against
acceptable standards set by other practitioners with similar training in a
similar community.
Be properly licensed and registered and meet all other legal
requirements to engage in the practice of dentistry.
Employ competent personnel and provides for their proper supervision.
Maintain a level of knowledge in keeping with current advances in the
profession.
Obtain informed consent from the patient before instituting an
examination or treatment.
Charge a reasonable fee for services based on community standards.
Keep the patient informed of her or his progress.
Keep accurate records of the treatment rendered by the patient.
Maintain confidentiality of information.
Make appropriate referrals and request necessary consultations.
Comply with all laws regulating the practice of dentistry.

=== PAGE 794 ===

Duties owed by the Patient
In accepting the care, the patient should
Follow home care instructions.
Appointments will be kept.
Patient will co-operate in case.
Bills for services will be paid in a reasonable time.
That the patient will notify the dentist of a change in health status.
II. Dentist-staff contract
This should include a job description, pay, holiday entitlements, bonuses,
loyalty and sickness allowances, disciplinary rules and termination
procedures with details of notice required by each party.

Torts
A tort is a civil wrong or injury, independent of a contract, that results from a
breach of a duty.
It is of 2 types
An unintentional tort is one in which harm was not intended as in the
case in tort of negligence.
An intentional tort contains the element of intended harm.
If the negligence involves an act that is performed in a professional
capacity, it is termed professional negligence or malpractice.
Professional Negligence
It is defined as a failure to exercise reasonable care in one’s professional
capacity.
Criminal Negligence
For criminal proceedings to be started the negligent action must be very
serious and have some accentuating factors (e.g. dentist was drunk or
drugged or disregarded well-known safety principles).
Contributory Negligence
When the actions of a patient have been partially (or completely) to blame for
the damage that occurred (e.g. failure to follow postoperative instruction).
Vicarious Liability
An employer can be held responsible for any negligence by an employee. A
dentist is responsible for the actions or omissions of his staff. A charge of
negligence can be brought against both employee and employer.
Legal Remedy
There are many avenues of legal remedy when negligence occurs.
Criminal liability
:
 IPC Section 304A: Grossly rash or grossly negligent

=== PAGE 796 ===
ii.
iii.
iv.
Act, which is proximate, direct or substantive cause of patient’s death.
Civil liability: Indian Contract Act Section 73 and 74.
Indian Medical/Dental Council Act 1948.
Consumer Protection Act 1986.
Trespass to the Person (Assault and Battery)
It constitutes a threat to harm (assault) and unauthorized touching (battery).
Traditionally, lack of informed consent to care was treated as assault and
battery.
Misrepresentation (Deceit)
Patient must be kept informed of their treatment status. If information is
withheld that places a patient’s health in jeopardy of deprives the patient of
the legal right to bring suit against the practitioner, a legal action (or)
fraudulent concealment may result. The problems in dentistry most
frequently associated with deceit and fraudulent concealment include the
failure to inform the patient when an instrument breaks off in a root canal,
when a root is fractured and the tip remains in the jaw, and when the dentist
is aware that the services of the treatment will be compromised because of
lack of co-operation by the patient.
Defamation
It is the publication of false statement which lowers the reputation of a man.
Defamation can be statements with the intention of discrediting a person,
expressing hatred contempt or ridicule.
Breach of Confidentiality
Information obtained from the patients in the course of diagnosis (or)
treatment must remain confidential.
The patient’s dental record is a legal document. It serves many purposes
in the judicial process. It contains information about the patient’s complaint,
health history, and basis for the diagnosis, and it reports all treatment
rendered, the patient’s reaction to treatment, and the results of the treatment.
Case law requires that health practitioners keep accurate records of the

diagnosis and treatment of their patients.
At one time, doctors had the exclusive right to the possession of the
record and its contents. Today, the doctor is considered the custodian of the
record and the patient has a property right in its contents. If the patient
demands in writing to be sent a copy to the treatment record or demands that
a copy be sent to another practitioner or to any other person or agency, you
should comply with the request.
Consent
The general principle that a doctor who treats a patient without the patient’s
consent is guilty of unauthorized touching, for which the doctor can be held
liable to the patient in damage.
Treatment without any consent is assault. Therefore to be valid, consent
should be “informed”.
Content of Consent
The patient must be informed of all the following:
Description of the proposed treatment
Material or foreseeable risks
Benefits and prognosis of proposed treatment
Alternatives to proposed treatment
Risks, benefits and prognosis of the alternative treatments.
All these factors must be described to the patient in language the patient
understands and the patient must be given an opportunity to ask questions
and have questions answered.

State consumer protection council constituted in line with the central
council and the members constituted by the state government.
Arguments for and Against
CPA is a piece of comprehensive legislation and recognizes 6 rights of the
consumer. Right to safety, right to be informed, right to choose, right to be
heard, right to seek redressal, right to education.
The medical community is fighting against the inclusion of medicare
under CPA.
Arguments for CPA
Doctors are not above law.
Doctors are accountable for their actions.
Medical councils cannot give compensation.
Speedy Justice does not mean a summary trial. The procedures
followed in civil courts are applicable to consumer forums.
Malpractice suits are decided by civil courts.
The composition of the forum is such that the decisions will be made
on the basis of law, reasonableness, fairness and good faith.
Arguments Against CPA
Medical services cannot be compared to household appliances.
Medical services are personal in nature and not the type offered by
manufacturers of consumer products.
The state medical councils are the authorities to hear complaints of
such nature.
Doctors would be harassed, corruption will seep in.
Patient will be the loser, as doctors will not attend to patients with even
slightly complicated ailments.
Doctors will practice defensive medicine.
Forum consists only of non-professional people, who cannot appreciate
the complex issues in medical care.

If the complaint is dismissed, the reputation of the doctor is at stake.
Only the commission has a judicial background ground, in case of
difference of opinion, majority will prevail.
What to do and what not to do if you are used
:
If a patient threatens you in writing with or suit, if you receive a letter
threatening suit from an attorney representing a patient, or if you receive a
summons, the following apply.
Things to do
:
At the earliest time after receiving the letter (or) summons, report it to
your insurance carrier by telephone.
Make a copy of the papers and send the originals to your carrier, use

FORENSIC DENTISTRY
Forensic dentists or odontologists, provide the dental component to determine
the identity of a body when visual identification or methods such as DNA
profiling and fingerprinting are inadequate or not possible. Forensic dentistry
has a major role in the identification process of a diseased person of unknown
identity.

=== PAGE 806 ===

Forensic Team
There are two types of dental identification team:
Traditional dental team which consists of chief forensic dentist and
includes dentists, hygienists and dental assistants.
Disaster mortuary operational response team (DMORT) consists of a
dental team, forensic pathology team, anthropology and laboratory
support, photographic and communication support, logistics team and
mortuary science team.

Dental Identification
Teeth are the most durable organs in the body, able to survive temperature of
1600 degree celsius and remain virtually intact long after other soft or
skeletal tissues have decayed or been incinerated. Hence they are recognized
as one of the most valuable individualizing features of the human body and
so used for identification.
Dental identification process involves:
Post-mortem assessment (physical characteristics of the diseased)
The odontologists obtains post-mortem dental information which
includes,
Visual examination of the oral structure (endodontic treatment,
implants, charting of existing restoration, tori, unusual anatomic
features, etc.)
Radiograph (full mouth, bitewing and panoramic)
Photograph (facial and intraoral)
Impressions
Ante-mortem assessment (physical characteristics made prior to death)
Ante-mortem dental information to be gathered includes
Original radiographs.
Original complete dental records
Availability of dental models used for diagnostic purpose or for
fabrication of prosthesis.
When all post-mortem and ante-mortem information is obtained and
charted, the results can be compared and a conclusion reached with a high
degree of reliability and simplicity.

=== PAGE 808 ===

Personal Identification
The teeth, jaws and orofacial characteristics are used for personal
identification. The three types of personal identification system are:
Comparative dental identification
:
 It involves the comparison of post-
mortem and ante-mortem dental records to determine if the body is that
of the person of interest.
Reconstrutive post-mortem dental profiling
:
 It is used when there is
no suspicion as to the identity of the decedent.
Dental DNA profiling
:
 It is used when dental records are unavailable.
It focuses on the application of modern forensic DNA profiling
methods to oral tissues.

=== PAGE 809 ===
Conclusion
The increasing use of sealants and composite resins are challenging the
reliability and accuracy of dental identification methods. Forensic dentistry
will, however, remain an important tool for identifying a diseased person of
unknown identity.

Prevention of
Oral Diseases
Oral health problems arise mainly as a result of two oral diseases: Dental
caries and periodontal disease. Although the prevalence of these two diseases
is changing, it remains true that virtually every adult in the world has
experience of either one disease or both.
Satisfactory oral health is difficult to achieve throughout the developing
world not only because of increase in oral diseases but also because of lack of
preventive programmes. This chapter looks into a preventive approach of
dental diseases, which can be implemented at all levels of development.

=== PAGE 830 ===
Prevention
(Blackerby) It is defined as the efforts, which are made to maintain normal
development, physiological function and to prevent diseases of the mouth and
adjacent parts.
(Learell and Clark) It is defined as the interception of the disease process.

=== PAGE 831 ===
Preventive Dentistry
It encompasses all aspects of dentistry and those practices by dental
professionals, individuals and communities that affect oral health. It has been
conceptualized in a number of ways.

=== PAGE 832 ===

LEVELS OF PREVENTION
 
(
Table 19.1
)
I. Primary Prevention
It is defined as the “action taken prior to the onset of disease, which removes
the possibility that a disease will ever occur”.
2
The concept of primary prevention is now being applied to the prevention
of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, dental
caries, periodontal disease based on elimination or modification of “risk
factors” of disease. The WHO recommended the following approaches for
the primary prevention of chronic diseases where the risk factors are
established:
Primordial prevention
Population (mass) strategy
High risk strategy.
Table 19.1:
 
Levels of prevention
Primordial Prevention
This is primary prevention in its purest sense. In primordial prevention efforts
are directed towards discouraging children from adopting harmful lifestyles
(use of tobacco, eating patterns, adverse oral habits). The main intervention is
through individual and mass education.
2
Population (Mass) Strategy
This approach is directed at the whole population irrespective of individual

=== PAGE 833 ===
risk levels. For example, water fluoridation.
High Risk Strategy
The high risk strategy aims to bring preventive care to individuals at special
risk. This requires detection of individuals at high risk.
Primary prevention is a desirable goal. To have an impact on the
population, all the above three approaches should be implemented.

=== PAGE 834 ===
II. Secondary Prevention
It employs routine treatment methods to 
terminate
 a disease process and to
restore
 tissues to as near normal as possible.

=== PAGE 835 ===
III. Tertiary Prevention
It employs measures necessary to 
replace
 lost tissues and to 
rehabilitate
patients to the point that function is as near normal as possible after the
failure of secondary prevention.

=== PAGE 836 ===

PREVENTIVE SERVICES
These are also the modes of intervention, which can be defined as any
attempt to intervene or interrupt the usual sequence in the development of
disease in man. The modes of intervention are
Health promotion
Specific protection
Early diagnosis and treatment
Disability limitation
Rehabilitation

=== PAGE 837 ===

Health Promotion
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over,
and to improve health. It is not directed against any particular disease, but is
intended to strengthen the host through a variety of approaches. The well-
known interventions in this area are:
2
Health education
Environmental modifications
Nutritional interventions
Lifestyle and behavioural changes

=== PAGE 838 ===
1.
2.
3.
4.
Specific Protection
To avoid disease altogether is the ideal but this is possible only in a limited
number of cases. The following are some of the currently available
interventions aimed at specific protection.
Immunization.
Chemoprophylaxis.
Protection against occupational hazards, accidents, carcinogens.
Use of specific nutrients.

=== PAGE 839 ===
Early Diagnosis and Treatment
Early detection and treatment are the main interventions of disease control.
The earlier a disease is diagnosed and treated the better it is from the point of
view of prognosis and preventing the occurrence of further cases or any long-
term disability.

=== PAGE 840 ===
Disability Limitation
When a patient reports late in a pathogenesis phase, the mode of intervention
is disability limitation. The objective of this intervention is to prevent or halt
the transition of the disease process from impairment to handicap. Disability
is defined as any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the
manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.

=== PAGE 841 ===
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is defined as the combined and coordinated use of medical,
social, educational, vocational measures for training and retraining the
individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.

=== PAGE 842 ===
PREVENTION OF ORAL DISEASES
The global perspectives of preventive dentistry is based on the premise that
every oral health activity implemented by the individual, the community or
the dental professional is targeted towards the prevention of some aspects of
the health-disease continuum. Coordinated efforts by the individual,
community and the dental professional are needed to attain and maintain
optimum oral health because of the complexity of disease etiology. A
multitude of preventive dentistry services targeted towards dental caries,
periodontal disease, oral cancer and oro-facial defects, malocclusion and
accidents, are presented in the

PLAQUE CONTROL
Plaque control is the removable of microbial plaque and the prevention of its
accumulation on the teeth and adjacent gingival surfaces. Plaque control also
retards the formation of calculus. Removal of microbial plaque leads to the
resolution of gingival inflammation in its early stages.
2
Plaque control is an effective way of treating and preventing gingivitis
and is therefore a critical part of all the procedures involved in the prevention
of periodontal diseases.
To date, the most dependable mode of controlling microbial plaque is still
by mechanical cleansing with a toothbrush and other hygiene aids.
Considerable progress has also been made with chemical inhibitors of plaque
incorporated in mouthwashes or dentifrices.
Plaque control is one of the keystones of the practice dentistry.

I. Mechanical Plaque Control
Calculus formation is reduced significantly by proper plaque control.
Bacterial plaque can be removed effectively by mechanical means.
Mechanical plaque control is safe and effective. It permits the patients to
assume responsibility for their own oral health.
1. Toothbrush (Manual)
A manual toothbrush is made up of handle, a head and bristles. When the
bristles are bunched together, they are known as tufts. There is a constriction
between handle and the head, termed the shank. The head is arbitrarily
divided into the toe, which is at the extreme end of the head and the heel,
which is closest to the handle. Toothbrushes are manufactured in three
different sizes, large, medium and small to adapt to the oral anatomy of
different individuals. Toothbrushes also differ in their defined hardness or
stiffness, usually classified as hard, medium and soft (
Fig. 20.1
).
5
Fig. 20.1:
 Manual toothbrush
2. Electric Toothbrush
The head of the electric toothbrush is smaller than the manual toothbrush and
is removable for replacements (
Fig. 20.2
). The three basic patterns that the
head follows when the motor is started are:
Reciprocating
:
 A back and forth movement.
Arcuate
:
 Up and down movement
Elliptical
:
 A combination of reciprocating and arcuate.

2. Interdental Oral Hygiene Aids (
Fig. 20.3
)
Interdental oral hygiene aids are used to remove plaque and debris that are
adherent to the teeth, restorations, orthodontic appliances, and gingiva in the
interproximal embrasures. It polishes the surfaces as it removes the debris.
They are used for massaging the interdental papillae and to reduce gingival
bleeding. Interdental cleaning aids contribute to general oral sanitation and
the control of halitosis.

=== PAGE 852 ===
Fig. 20.3:
 Flossing method
3. Dentifrices
Dentifrice is defined as a substance used with a toothbrush for the purpose of
cleaning the accessible surfaces of the teeth. Dentifrices are available as tooth
powders, toothpastes, liquids and gels. They are either cosmetic or
therapeutic.

Abrasives
Calcium carbonate and calcium phosphates were previously the most
common abrasives used. Now, silicon oxides, aluminium oxides and granular
polyvinyl chlorides are used. Abrasives often dull the tooth luster. To
compensate for this, polishing agents are usually added. Small-sized particles
of aluminium, calcium, tin, magnesium or zirconium compounds are used as
polishing agents.
Humectants
Humectants are added to maintain the moisture. Sorbitol, mannitol and
propylene glycol are the most common humectants. It helps to maintain the
consistency of the paste.
Foaming Agent: Soaps and Detergents
Sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium N-lauroyl-sarcosinate are probably the
most used detergents. They are stable, possess some antibacterial properties,
and have a low surface tension, which facilitates the flow of the dentifrice
over the teeth.
Flavouring Agent

=== PAGE 854 ===
Flavour must be pleasant, provide an immediate taste sensation and have a
relatively long-lasting flavour.
Sweetening Agent
Saccharin, sorbitol and mannitol serve as sweetening agents. Glycerine,
which also serves as humectants, adds to the sweet taste.
Preservative
Benzoic acid is used as a preservative to prevent bacterial growth on binding
agent.

II. Chemical Plaque Control
 (
Table 20.2
)
Chemical control of dental plaque may involve prevention of plaque
formation, removal on dispersion of existing plaque, inhibition of
calcification of existing plaque, or altering the pathogenicity of plaque.
Chemicals interfere at various stages of development of plaque.
3
Microorganisms responsible for plaque formation may be eliminated or
reduced in number.
The formation of bacterial and salivary products which constitute the
intermicrobial substance in plaque may be inhibited.
Established plaques may be dissolved.
Calcification of plaque may be counteracted.
Colonization of bacteria on the tooth surface may be inhibited.
Pathogenicity of plaque may be reduced by interference with the
metabolism of plaque bacteria.
Table 20.2:
 
Chemical plaque control

=== PAGE 856 ===
Antibiotics
Penicillin, vancomycin, erythromycin, nidda-mycin and kanamycin were
tried as antiplaque agents. Vancomycin is a bacterial antibiotic and is poorly
absorbed after oral dose. It was found to be quite effective in hospitalized
patients for control of plaque formation.
Phenols
Antibacterial action of phenols depends on its ability to penetrate the lipid
component of the cell walls of gram negative organisms. Listerine is a
phenol, containing mouthwash that is widely used. It has been found to be an
effective inhibitor of plaque formation when used as an adjunct to mechanical

=== PAGE 857 ===
methods.
Enzyme Preparations
Enzymes capable of breaking down the matrix of already formed plaque were
considered for inhibition of plaque and calculus formation.
For example, mucinase, dehydrated pancreas, mutanase, dextranase, etc.
Quaternary Ammonium Compounds
These are cationic antiseptics and surface active charge, which reacts with the
negatively charged cell membrane phosphates and the cell wall structure of
microorganism is disrupted.
Cetylpyridinium and benzethonium chloride have been found to inhibit
plaque.
Bisbiguanides
Chlorhexidine gluconate and alexidine are the most effective antiplaque
agents. Chlorhexidine may bind to anionic acid groups on salivary
glycoproteins thus reducing plaque formation. It reduces the gingival
inflammation also.
0.2% Chlorhexidine solution used as mouth rinse twice daily is quite
effective in total plaque inhibition.
Metallic Salts
Zinc sulphate and zinc citrate have been found to have inhibitory effect on
plaque formation.
Therapeutic Dentifrice
A therapeutic dentifrice may be described as one that contains a drug
substance that has been incorporated into the formulation in an effort to
produce a beneficial effect upon the oral tissues.
The most commonly used active agent added to dentifrices is fluoride,
which aids in control of caries.
Tetra sodium phosphate and disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphates are

=== PAGE 858 ===
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
used to significantly reduce the amount of calculus formed. The soluble
pyrophosphates are crystal-growth inhibitors and retard the formation of
calculus. The dentifrices with these agents are called anti-calculus dentifrices.
Dentifrices used in hypersensitivity are with active agents like potassium
nitrate, strontium chloride, etc.
For example
,
Dentifrices containing potassium nitrate: 5%.
Dentifrices containing potassium nitrate and sodium.
Dentifrices containing strontium chloride hexahydrate: 10%.
Dentifrices containing sodium fluoride-0.05%.
Dentifrices containing potassium chloride and sodium monofluoro
phosphate.
Dentifrices containing potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride.
Therapeutic Mouth Rinse
A mouth rinse may be defined as a substance that is swished around the oral
cavity and then expectorated in order to freshen the mouth and breath.
The therapeutic mouth rinse can be defined as a formulation containing a
drug substance and used to transfer this drug substance to hard and soft
tissues of the oral cavity. This drug substance then imparts a chemical,
physiologic or pharmacologic action that is manifested clinically as a
reduction in the incidence of plaque, caries, calculus and gingival disease.
4
The first therapeutic, anticaries mouth rinse to be used extensively was 0.2%
sodium fluoride rinse.
Chlorhexidine mouth rinse proved to be most effective anti-plaque agent
that helps in controlling inflammation and subgingival plaque. It is safe,
stable and effective in preventing plaque formation, in suppressing
Streptococcus mutans
, and in treating marginal gingivitis.
Oral Irrigation Devices
Mouth rinses provide a means to irrigate the entire mouth; irrigation devices
provide a means to irrigate specific areas of the mouth. There are two types

of irrigation devices, the spray, which provides an aerosol and the irrigation
device which provides a steady or pulsating stream of fluid.
Three situations in which an irrigating device are used:
To help remove accumulated debris from interdental areas where there
is difficult access.
The aid in personal oral hygiene program of individuals with
orthodontic devices, complex restorations, crowns and fixed bridges,
splints.
To irrigate deeper gingival sulci.

Conclusion
Plaque is formed so rapidly and its removal by the patient is so difficult that
complete freedom from plaque over extended periods of time is an unrealistic
goal.
Complete prevention of plaque formation is not possible by conventional
mechanical means and not practical by current chemical means. Instead, the
goal of clinical plaque control at present is periodic mechanical or chemical
plaque removal at intervals spaced closely enough together to prevent
recurrent plaque formation and any resulting significant pathological effects.

DISCLOSING AGENTS
A disclosing agent is a preparation in liquid, tablet, or lozenge form that
contains a dye or other coloring agent. In dentistry, a disclosing agent is used
to identify bacterial plaque deposits for instruction, evaluation and research.
1
Bacterial plaque is nearly colorless unless stained by foods, beverages or
tobacco. After use of a disclosing agent, the soft deposits pick up the color of
the agent, whereas the dye can be rinsed off readily from plaque-free
surfaces.

Purpose
Personalized patient instruction in the location of soft deposits and the
techniques for removal.
Self-evaluation by the patient on a daily basis.
Continuing evaluation of the effectiveness of the instructions for the
patient to determine the need for revisions of the plaque control
procedures.
Preparation of plaque indices.
To gain new information about the incidence and formation of deposits
on the teeth, effectiveness of specific devices for plaque control,
antiplaque agents, etc.
Ideal Properties
Intensity of color
:
 A distinct staining of deposits should be evident.
The color should contrast with normal colors of oral cavity.
Duration of intensity
:
 The color should not rinse off immediately with
ordinary rinsing methods.
Taste
:
 The patient should not be made uncomfortable by an unpleasant
or highly flavored substance. It should be pleasant and encourage co-
operation of the patient.
Irritation to the mucous membrane
:
 It should produce no irritation or
allergic reaction. Because of possibility of allergy, more than one type
of disclosing agent should be available for use.
Diffusibility
:
 A solution should be thin enough so it can be applied
readily to the exposed surfaces of the teeth.

This apparatus consists of a small mains operated lamp which gives light
through a special dichroic filter. A bottle of a fluorescein-based solution is
supplied and two drops of this are introduced into the mouth and the patient
is instructed to swish it in the saliva all around the mouth. The indicator fluid
has a special affinity for plaque but is relatively invisible until the light makes
it appear with a greenish yellow glow. The effect is startling and dramatic and
may well be responsible for an added keenness to remove the offending
glow.

Having demonstrated the presence of plaque the dentist’s responsibility is
of:
Removing it.
Ensuring that the patient can remove it and prevent its formation, on
the mouth and teeth, where possible to discourage bacterial growth and

Method of Application
Plaque test is generously applied to the surfaces of the teeth with the help of
applicator brush and patients were instructed to rinse the mouth. It exposes
plaque on teeth as a yellow colour and on gingiva as a green colour. The teeth
appear blue and the gingival tissues dark blue under a blue light source. As a
result, plaque can be clearly distinguished from the surrounding tissues (
Fig.
20.6
).
Fig. 20.6
Advantages Over other Plaque Disclosing Agents
Fluorescein only colours plaque; the gums, tongue natural teeth and
restorations keep their own colour. In addition, fluorescein is not
visible in daylight and, as a result, the use of the Plaque Test does not
entail any esthetic impairment.
The taste of fluorescein is generally described as acceptable.
Fluorescein is better suited for digital quantification methods than
erythrosine because the latter colours plaque in a red-purple colour and
consequently does not create sufficient contrast to the red colour of the
gingiva. Therefore, the Plaque Test is also suitable for the systematic

=== PAGE 871 ===
computer-based evaluation of plaque build-up, e.g. in the course of a
clinical study.

=== PAGE 872 ===
A NEW SYSTEM FOR DISCLOSING PLAQUE IN
THE HOME SETTING
PlaqPro:
 It is a Fluorescein based toothpaste and toothbrush/light system
(
Fig. 20.7
).
Fig. 20.7

=== PAGE 873 ===
Composition
Apart from containing Fluorescein, the toothpaste is designed to a somewhat
different formulation. It contains an elevated level of the sweetener, Xylitol,
which is known to inhibit the growth of the plaque bacteria 
Streptococcus
mutans
. The Xylitol also stimulate the mouth to produce more saliva and at a
higher pH, so increasing its potential to remineralise weak enamel.
Conversely, the paste has none of the usual silica thickener found in most
toothpastes. While this lowers the paste’s viscosity, it also removes any
tendency to dry the mouth. The ‘hydrated’ silica abrasive used is fine grade,
which reduces the risk of ‘toothbrush abrasion’ and also contains sodium
fluoride.

=== PAGE 874 ===
Steps 1 to 3 Illustrate the System in Use
Step 1:
 Patients are instructed to brush their teeth with Fluorescein toothpaste
(

CARIES ACTIVITY TEST
Caries is a multifactorial disease, the many contributing factors can be
grouped into three categories: (1) Those microorganisms that constitute a
challenge to the integrity of the tooth, (2) tooth and host resistance to the
challenge, (3) remineralization capacity (repair). The objective of caries
activity testing is to indentify some parameters related to the triad of
challenge, defence and repair that will indicate impending or existent caries
activity or inactivity. Such information can be used to help estimate the
probability for caries but more importantly to formulate strategies for the
prevention of disease.
1
Criteria of Caries Activity Test
3
The test should be reproducible.
The test should be valid.
The test should be simple and inexpensive to perform.
The test should be noninvasive, easy to evaluate and applicable to any
clinical setting.
There should be a minimal occurrence of false responses.

Permits the identification of the individuals with higher probability of
developing caries.
Institutes intensive effective primary-preventive measures designed to
arrest and to reverse the disease process before the irreversible point of
the caries has been reached.
Provides a patient an individual preventive program to be implemented
before extensive dental restorative procedures are accomplished.
Helps to screen large segments of population such as schoolchildren.
To understand the caries process better.

=== PAGE 879 ===
Caries Activity Tests
1
1. Lactobacilli Colony Count Test
The first microbiologic caries activity test that was used by practitioners was
the lactobacilli colony count. The lactobacilli counts were performed by
using serial dilutions of saliva that was collected by chewing 1 gm paraffin
wafer. A 1 ml aliquot from each dilution was then placed in a series of petri
dishes, to which was added approximately 10 ml of Ragosa’s lactobacilli
selective medium. After incubating 4 days the number of colonies was
counted. Counts were often scored 1 to 4, depending on whether they fell
with in the ranges of 0 to 1000, 1000 to10,000, 10,000 to 100,000 or 100,000
and up. When the score increased for a group of individuals, so did the caries
score increase.
2. Snyder’s Test
This calorimetric test is much easier for the private practitioner to use than
the preceding lactobacilli counts. It is based on the assumption that the
amount of acid produced in a medium is proportionate to the number of
lactobacilli in the inoculum. The selective medium used for the test has a pH
of approximately 5.0 which is optimum for lactobacilli growth. To evaluate
visually the rapidity and extent of acid production, bromocresol green is
incorporated into the medium to indicate pH change. The medium is blue at
pH 5.0, green at 4.6, yellowish at 4.2, and yellow at 3.8. A standardized color
chart is used as an aid in determining the colour changes. The medium is
initially prepared by adding 1 litre of boiling water to 61 g of the powdered
Snyder’s medium and adjusting pH with glacial acetic acid. Approximately 5
ml of medium is placed in sterile test tubes that are stored in a refrigerator.
To perform the test a specimen of saliva is secured with paraffin
stimulation. One tube from refrigerator is heated to 100 degree celsius to
liquefy the agar. It is then cooled to 45 degree celsius before 0.1 ml of the
saliva specimen is added and the tube shaken before being placed in the
incubator for 72 hours at 37 degree celsius. At the end of 24 hours and again
at 48 and 72 hours, the color of the medium is recorded as 1 to 4 on the basis
of whether the color remains the same or changes to light green, a light
yellow, or a definite yellow in 24 hours, the individual is considered as caries

=== PAGE 880 ===
resistant. In-between scores are less informative but can be used along with
clinical judgement as an aid in evaluating caries status.
Snyder’s test has the advantage of requiring only one tube of medium and
no serial dilutions. Yet because of the need to use a controlled temperature to
melt the agar before adding the saliva specimen, the test is still best
accomplished in a laboratory environment. This discourages office use of the
test.
The classical formula of Synder’s agar per litre of purified water is,
Pancreatic digest of casein
13.5 g
Yeast extract
6.5 g
Dextrose
20.0 g
Sodium chloride
5.0 g
Agar
16.0 g
Bromocresol green
0.029 g
3. Alban’s Test (Modified Snyder Test)
Arthur L. Alban modified the basic Snyder test to accomplish easily the
caries activity test for routine dental office use. This modified Snyder test
uses the same formula as Snyder’s media, with the exception that less agar is
added. This modification permits an easier permeation of bacterial metabolic
end products throughout the agar column.
At the time of the test, a 5 ml tube of semisolid agar is removed from the
refrigerator but it is not heated. The patient is asked to spit unstimulated
saliva directly into the tube until there is thin layer of saliva covering the
surface of green agar. The tube is then incubated for 4 days, with daily
recordings is made to observe color changes produced by the acidogenic
organisms in the salivary specimen. The color changes are scored from 0 to 4,
with the score being based on the amount of color changes occuring from top
to bottom in the tube.
A zero score indicates no color change.
A 1 + score indicates color change to yellow in the top ¼ of tube.
A 2+ score indicates color change to yellow in the ½ mark of tube.
A 3+ score indicates color change to yellow in the ¾ mark of tube.

=== PAGE 881 ===
A 4+ score indicates entire length of agar column has changed to
yellow.
The Alban test is ideal for patient education. Favourable changes in diet
intake and plaque control procedures are reflected within a few weeks by
corresponding changes in the Alban test score.
Other tests include the following:
4. Salivary Buffer Capacity Test
5. Enamel Solubility Test (Susceptibility Test)
6. Salivary Reductase Test
7. Streptococcus mutans Level in Saliva

PIT AND FISSURE SEALANTS
Definition
Pit and fissure sealants are defined as ‘a cement or a resin which is introduced
into unprepared occlusal pits and fissures of caries susceptible teeth forming
a mechanical and physical protective layer against the action of acid
producing bacteria and their substrates’ (
Fig. 20.11
).

Types
Three different kinds of plastics have been used as occlusal sealants:
Polyurethanes,
Cyanoacrylates and
Bisphenol A-glycidylmethylacrylate-(BIS–GMA)
Polyurethanes
:
 They were among the first to appear on the
commercial market. They proved to be too soft and totally
disintegrated in the mouth after 2–3 months. Despite this problem, their
use was continued for a period of time—not as a sealant but as a
vehicle with which to apply fluoride to the teeth. This function has
been superceded by the use of fluoride varnishes which are easier to
apply.
3
Cyanoacrylates
:
 They have also been tried as sealants, but they too
disintegrated after a slightly longer period of time. The ADA council
on dental materials did not recommend the cyanoacrylates for routine
use in dentistry because formaldehyde was formed as a part of their
biodegradation in the oral fluids.
2
BIS-GMA
:
 Bisphenol-A glycidylmethyl-acrylate is now the sealant of
choice. It is a mixture of BIS-GMA and methyl methacrylate. Some of
the first commercial products:
Concise brand white sealant (3M company)
Delton, clear and tinted (Johnson and Johnson)
Helioseal, white (vivadent)
Nuvaseal
Lately, more effective second and third generation sealant have become
available. Some of them contain fillers, which makes it desirable to classify
the commercial products into filled and unfilled sealants.
In addition to the BIS-GMA, the filled sealant contains microscopic glass
beads, quartz rods and other fillers used in composite restorations. The filler
makes the sealant more resistant to abrasion. The fillers are coated with
products such as silane, to facilitate their combination with BIS-GMA.

=== PAGE 887 ===
1.
2.
Polymerizing of the Sealants
The liquid plastic is called the monomer. When the monomer is acted upon
by the catalyst, repeating chemical bonds begin to form, increasing in number
and complexity as the hardening process (polymerization) proceeds. Finally
the resultant hard product is known as a polymer.
Two methods have been employed to catalyze polymerization:
Light curing by use of either an ultraviolet or visible blue light
(photocure, photoactivation, light activation).
Self curing where a monomer and a catalyst are mixed together (cold
cure, autopolymerization, chemical activation).
With the autopolymerising sealants, the catalyst is incorporated with the
monomer—in addition, another bottle contains an initiator—usually benzoyl
peroxide. While the monomer and the initiator are mixed, polymerisation
begins.
The High-Intensity Light Source
The light emitting device consists of a high-intensity white light, a blue filter
to produce the desired blue color usually between 400 nm and 500 nm and
light conducting rod. There are two types of lights, one is a hand-held model
with a short conducting rod, the other desk top model with a fiber glass cable
to conduct the light to the light rod. The time required for polymerization is
set by the manufacturer and is usually around 20–30 seconds.

=== PAGE 888 ===

Photocured Sealants
Advantages
Operator can initiate polymerization at any suitable time.
Polymerization time is shorter.
Higher compressive strength and smoother finish.
Disadvantage
Expensive.

5.
Self-cured Sealants
Advantage
Does not require expensive light source.
Disadvantage
Polymerization process cannot be controlled.
Requisites for Sealant Retention
The surface of a tooth should have a maximum surface area.
The tooth should have deep, irregular pits and fissures.
The tooth should be clean.
The tooth should be absolutely dry at the time of sealant placement.
The tooth surface should be uncontaminated with saliva residues.
Increasing the Surface Area
To increase the surface area, which in turn increases the adhesive potential,
tooth conditioners also called etchants which are composed of 30 to 50% of
concentration of phosphoric acid are placed on the occlusal surface prior to
the placement of the sealant. The etchant may be either in liquid or gel form.
Deep irregular pits and fissures offer a much more favourable surface contour
for sealant retention compared to broad, shallow fossae.

Procedure of Pit and Fissure Sealant Application
Surface cleanliness of the tooth.
Dryness of the tooth surface.
Preparing the tooth for sealant application.
Application of the sealant.
1. Surface Cleanliness of the Tooth
Usually the acid etching alone is sufficient for surface cleaning. Pumice and
water slurry are used to the occlusal surface. Slurry must be non-fluoride, oil
free mixture to avoid contamination of the tooth surface. Hydrogen peroxide
also been tried as a cleaning agent but, it has the disadvantage that it produces
a precipitate on the enamel surface. All heavy stains, deposits, and debris
should be off the occlusal surface before applying the sealant.
2. Dryness of the Tooth Surface
The teeth must be dry at the time of sealant placement. A dry field can be
maintained by several ways, such as by the use of rubber dam, applying
cotton rolls, bibulous pads over the opening of the parotid duct. Isolation of a
tooth are done mainly by using cotton rolls.
3. Preparing the Tooth for Sealant Application
After the selected teeth are isolated, they are thoroughly dried for
approximately 10 seconds. The liquid etchant is then placed on the tooth with
a small plastic sponge or cotton pledget held with cotton pliers. The etching
solution is gently daubed, not rubbed, on the surface for 1 minute for
permanent teeth and 1% minute for deciduous teeth.
Alternatively, acid gels are applied with a supplied syringe. At the end of
the etching period, for 10 seconds the water is flowed over the occlusal
surface. Following the water flush, the tooth surface is dried for 10 seconds.
The dried tooth surface should have a white, dull, frosty appearance. This is
due to the fact that the etching has removed approximately 5 to 10
micrometer of the original surface.

4. Application of the Sealant
When the plastic sealant flows over the prepared surface, it penetrates the
finger like depressions created by the etching solution. The projections of
plastic into the etched areas are called tags. These tags are essential for
retention. With either the photo cured or the auto polymerized sealants, the
material should be first placed in the fissures where there is the maximum
depth. The sealant should not only fill the fissures but should have some bulk
over the fissure. Following the polymerization, the sealant should be
examined carefully for voids. If there are any voids, additional sealants can
be added without the need for any additional etching. The hardened sealant
has an oily residue on the surface. This is the un-reacted monomer that can be
wiped off with a gauze sponge.

CARIES VACCINE
There exists the possibility of preventing dental caries by stimulating the
defense mechanism of the mouth. Mobilization or augmentation of the
defense systems of the body is perhaps the most attractive approach to the
prevention of infectious disease, as it involves working with natural functions
rather than cutting across them. The protection against caries by caries
vaccine has generated hopes and a significant progress has been made in this
field.
3

=== PAGE 895 ===
Mechanism of Action
Protection against dental caries by immunization could be achieved by
immune components from serum, by IgA antibodies in salivary secretions or
by a combined effect of serum and salivary components.
2
IgA antibodies from serum reach the oral cavity through the gingival
crevicular fluid. When the teeth erupt local inflammation is common, and
during this time, serum antibodies may stimulate opsonization and
phagocytosis of bacterial cells. Serum antibodies have shown to have an
inhibitory effect both on glucosyltransferase and on acid production. Such
antibodies could inhibit the establishment and metabolic activity of 
S. mutans
on teeth. This may explain experimental results in which a lower number of
S
. 
mutans
 and less dental caries in immunized animals than controls.
1
Thus parental immunization directed to 
S. mutans
 could favour the early
establishment of a non-cariogenic microflora on the teeth which in turn could
prevent or delay the colonization of pathogenic 
S. mutans
 and thereby
reduction in dental caries.
In the saliva, secretory IgA antibodies dominate and in the rodent model,
specific IgA antibodies have been found to protect animals against 
S. mutans
infection and dental caries
1
 (
Fig. 20.13
).

=== PAGE 896 ===
Summary
The development of an oral vaccine is an age old dream. Animal studies have
shown that immunization against 
Streptococcus mutans
 is feasible and yet to
date a successful vaccine for use in humans has not been developed.
Purified antigens can be expensive to produce which in turn will make
immunization less attractive for use on a public health basis. This however
would appear not to be an insurmountable problem because developing
technologies should make it possible to isolate economically the relevant
antigens in highly purified form. On the other hand, by using whole cells in
an encapsulated form via an oral route one is simulating a phenomenon
which occurs naturally, more or less continuously, and does not run the risk
of omitting several potentially important antigens.
Fig. 20.13:
 Diagrammatic illustration of the two main immunological
mechanisms involved in protecting the host against dental caries by
immunization. The first mechanism involves the production of secretory IgA
secreted in the saliva. The second mechanism involves the systemic immune
system and the production of antibodies that travel through the gingival
epithelium into circular fluid that bathes tooth and plaque (modified after
Lehner, 1978)
It is possible that a vaccine will not be widely accepted by the general
population, nevertheless, it is highly probable that a vaccine can and will be
developed if it is developed, its value will presumably be found primarily in

=== PAGE 897 ===
those subjects who appear to be particularly susceptible to caries and those
who for medical reasons such as hemophiliacs should be totally protected
from caries.
Perhaps, a vaccine may be developed in the years to come but for now
people have recourse to the good old standbys brushing, flossing, regular
dental checkups and water fluoridation.

MINIMAL INTERVENTION DENTISTRY
Introduction
The ideal aim of preventive dentistry is to avoid disease altogether, but this is
not possible in all cases. However, we can aim for both an early diagnosis
and a minimally invasive therapy to ensure the existing early carious lesion is
treated and the progress arrested.
The minimally invasive approach in treating dental caries incorporates the
dental science of detecting, diagnosing, intercepting and treating dental caries
at microscopic level.

Principles of Minimal Intervention Dentistry
2
The four core principles can be summarized as follows:
Recognition
:
 To identify and assess any potential caries risk factors
early, through lifestyle analysis, saliva testing and using plaque
diagnostic tests.
Reduction
:
 To eliminate or minimize caries risk factors, through
altering fluid balance, reducing the intake of dietary cariogenic foods,
addressing lifestyle habits such as smoking, and increasing the pH of
the oral environment.
Regeneration
:
 To arrest and reverse incipient lesions, regenerating
enamel subsurface lesions and arresting root surface lesions using
appropriate topical agents including fluorides and casein
phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphates (CPP-ACP).
Repair
:
 When cavitation is present and surgical intervention is
required, as much as possible of the tooth structure is maintained by
using conservative approaches to caries removal. Bioactive materials
are used to restore the tooth and promote internal healing of the
dentine, particularly in cases of deep dentine caries where the risk of
iatrogenic pulpal injury is high.

MODALITIES
Remineralising Agents
CPP-ACP (Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate)
:
 CPP-
ACP is a rather new way of remineralizing tooth surfaces by keeping high
levels of calcium and phosphorus ions in the proximity of the enamel. Casein
phosphopeptides bind the calcium and phosphate ions forming CPP-ACP-
complexes (casein phosphopeptide stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate)
which release calcium and phosphorus ions at pH values below 7.
3
 CPP-ACP
binds readily to the surface of the tooth, under acidic conditions, this
localized CPP-ACP buffers the free calcium and phosphate ions, substantially
increases the level of calcium phosphate in plaque and, therefore, maintains a
state of supersaturation that inhibits enamel demineralisation and enhances
remineralisation.
1
CPP-ACP is available commercially as:
Tooth mousse
Tooth mousse plus (CPP-ACP+sodiumfluoride)
MI paste
MI paste plus (CPP-ACP + sodium fluoride)
GC MI varnish (CPP-ACP + sodium fluoride)

Titanium Tetrafluoride
4
McCann suggested an additional mechanism for fluoride fixation in enamel
in which the fluoride is bound to a polyvalent metal ion in the form of a
strong complex. He discovered that both fluoride uptake and retention could
be enhanced when the tooth is pretreated with any polyvalent metal capable
of forming strong fluoride complexes while simultaneously binding to the
apatite crystals. Titanium ion pre-treatment showed the maximum uptake and
retention, followed by aluminium (among various metals such as Al, Ti, Zr,
La, Fe, Be, Sn, Mg, Zn).
When compared with other topically used fluorides, the use of TiF
4
 seems
to have great advantages. Higher uptake and greater penetration of fluoride
and lower acid solubility of the tissues has been seen with TiF
4
 when
compared to NaF. It was observed that in addition to increasing the fluoride
content, topical application of TiF
4
 may also change the surface morphology
of enamel.
The marked protective effect of TiF
4
 is attributed to the following:
Chemically decreasing enamel solubility by increasing the fluoride
content and
Physically providing a protective glaze resistant to any acid
penetration.

=== PAGE 903 ===
Enamelon
1
Enamelon consists of unstabilized calcium and phosphate salts with sodium
fluoride. The calcium salts are separated from the phosphate salts and sodium
fluoride by a plastic divider in the centre of the toothpaste tube. An inherent
technical issue with Enamelon™ is that calcium and phosphate are not
stabilized, allowing the two ions to combine into insoluble precipitates before
they come into contact with saliva or enamel.

=== PAGE 904 ===
Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF)
Topical application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has been receiving more
and more attention due to its low cost and simplicity in treatment. The
advantages of caries treatment with SDF include its attributes of pain and
infection control, ease of use, low material costs, non-invasive nature of the
treatment procedure, and minimal requirement for personnel time and
training. A recent systematic review
5
 concluded that SDF treatment may
fulfil the World Health Organization (WHO) millennium goals and the
United States Institute of Medicine’s criteria for 21
st
 century medical care.
SDF treatment can potentially increase access to care, improve oral health,
and reduce the need for emergency care and treatment
5
.
The exact mechanism of SDF is not understood. Yamaga and his co-
workers
6
 suggest that both fluoride ions and silver ions contribute to its
mechanism of action. They propose that fluoride ions act mainly on tooth
structure while silver ions act mainly on cariogenic bacteria. SDF reacts with
hydroxyapatite [Ca
10
(PO
4
)
6
 (OH)
2
] in an alkaline environment to form
calcium fluoride (CaF
2
) and silver phosphate (Ag
3
 PO
4
) as major reaction
products. CaF
2
 provides sufficient fluoride for the formation of fluoroapatite
[Ca
10
(PO
4
)
6
 F
2
], which is less soluble than hydroxyl apatite in an acidic
environment.
A literature review on SDF concluded that arresting caries treatment with
SDF can be a method to prevent caries from progression.

=== PAGE 905 ===
RESIN BASED SYSTEMS
Resin Infiltration
The resin infiltration technique prevents further progression of the carious
lesion using a low-viscosity resin with a high penetration coefficient, filling
the enamel intercrystalline spaces.
8
,
9
The pores within the lesion body of enamel caries provide diffusion
pathways for acids and dissolved minerals. Therefore, an alternative approach
to superficial sealing might be to arrest caries lesions by infiltration and
occlusion of these pores with light curing resins, thus creating a diffusion
barrier within the lesion without establishing any material on the enamel
surface. Driven by capillary forces, the infiltrant is soaked into the lesion
body where it is subsequently light-cured. The infiltrant occludes the lesion
porosities and thus blocks diffusion pathways for cariogenic acids.
Resin infiltration system is commercially available as DMG icon.

=== PAGE 906 ===
CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL METHODS
Chemico-Mechanical Caries Removal
The principal on which chemico-mechanical method for caries removal work
are based on studies by Goldman and Kronman working in New Jersey, US
in the early 1970s. This new method of treatment involves the chemical
softening of carious tissue followed by its removal by gentle excavation.
After certain trials the first product launched into the market was known
as, “Caridex”.

=== PAGE 907 ===
Caridex
10
It received FDA approval for use in the USA in 1984 and was marketed in
the 1980s. It is developed from a formula made of N-monochloroglycine and
amino butyric acid. The system was granted in the form of two bottles,
solution I having sodium hypochlorite and solution II having glycine,
aminobutyric acid, sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide. The system
involves the chlorination and disruption of the partially degraded collagen
fibres in carious dentine. The carious dentine then becomes easier to remove
by excavation using the modified needle tip.

=== PAGE 908 ===
•
•
Carisolv
10
Medi team in Sweden continued to work on the Caridex system and resulted
in the launch of chemico-mechanical caries removal reagent known as
Carisolv in January 1998. The fundamental dissmilarity between Carisolv
and other products already in the market was the use of three amino acids—
lysine, leucine and glutamic acid—instead of the amino butyric acid.
The entity is retailed in the form of two syringes
:
Syringe I—containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution
Syringe II—gel consisting of three amino acids.

=== PAGE 909 ===
Papacarie
10
In 2003, a research project in Brazil led to the development of a new formula
to globalize the use of chemico-mechanical method for caries removal and
promote its use in public health. Papacarie is intrinsically formed of papain
gel, chloramines, toludine blue, salts, thickening agent which altogether
idiosyncranise to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory features. It is
commercially available as a gel syringes that have 3 ml of solution.

Air Abrasion
1
Air abrasion was originally developed by Robert Black in 1945 as an
alternative pseudomechanical method for dental tissue removal and the first
air abrasion unit marketed was called the Airdent by SS White. This
technique involves bombarding the tooth surface with high velocity
aluminium oxide particles (Alumina) carried in a stream of air. This method
of cutting is relatively painless, however, the total loss of tactile sensation,
and the ability of alumina particles to remove sound tooth structure rather
than the carious substrate in addition to the potential risk of inhalation
problem should also be considered at the time of selection.
The abrasive units currently being marketed
The three KCP series (KCP 1000 Whisperjet, KCP 2000 and KCP
2000 Plus) (American Dental Technologies),
The MicroPrep (Sunrise Technologies) and
The Kreativ (Kreative Inc.).
Contraindications
It should be avoided in cases involving severe dust allergy, asthma, chronic
obstructive lung disease, recent extraction or other oral surgery, open
wounds, advanced periodontal disease, recent placement of orthodontic
appliances and oral abrasions, or subgingival caries removal. Many of these
conditions increase the risk of air embolism in the oral soft tissues.

=== PAGE 911 ===
Ozone
1
During the last few years, reversal of caries using ozone has also been
suggested based on the fact that the remineralised tooth tissues are known to
be more resistant to decay than sound tooth structure. Ozone therapy causes
remineralisation of incipient caries lesion.
Ozone readily penetrates through decayed tissue, eliminating the
ecological niche of cariogenic microorganisms as well as priming the carious
tissue for remineralisation. As ozone readily penetrates through decayed
tissue, eliminating any bacteria, fungi and viral contamination, it would be
expected that this ‘clean’ lesion would remineralise. The remineralisation
process will then take place with the aid of a topically applied remineralising
solution and the recommended patient’s maintenance kit.

=== PAGE 912 ===
Laser Irradiation
11
,
12
One of the potentially effective preventive measures is the use of lasers. As
early as 1966, Stern and Sognnaes, using an Nd:YAG (Neodymium-doped:
Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) laser, showed that irradiated enamel specimens
were resistant to acid demineralization. Highly absorbed wavelengths can
modify the tissue composition and structure by thermal action, and promote
an increased acid resistance. One of the most absorbed laser wavelength by
the enamel are Erbium wavelengths (2.94 μm @ Er:YAG and 2.79 μm @
Er,Cr:YSGG), for which the primary absorption occurs for water and
hydroxiapatite.
The widely accepted explanation for the increased acid resistance of the
enamel postirradiation with lasers is that bound carbonate is released when
dental enamel is heated.

=== PAGE 913 ===
Conclusion
These non-invasive and minimally invasive modalities point to a direction of
potential consistent benefit in prevention, slowing the progression or
reversing early carious lesions.

ATRAUMATIC RESTORATIVE TREATMENT
(ART)
Although dental caries has substantially decreased in the industrialized
countries, it remains to be a widespread problem all over the world. Most of
the carious teeth in the developing countries tend to go untreated to such an
extent that the only treatment option available is extraction.
Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) approach was developed to suit
the needs of the developing countries. ART includes both prevention and
treatment of dental caries. This procedure is based on excavating and
removing caries using hand instruments only and restoring the tooth with an
adhesive filling material such as glass ionomer.
3
Unlike the conventional methods ART is non-threatening, not painful,
therefore does not need anaesthesia, does not use expensive electrically
driven equipment and can be provided at low cost. This technique is simple
enough to train non-dental personnel or primary healthcare workers. All one
needs are a flat surface for the patient to lie, a stool for the operator and the
necessary instruments and materials for ART which can easily be carried in a
small bag. ART therefore is suited for people residing in remote areas and for
field practise and can be carried out in schools, village halls or in health
centers with minimum equipment and resources. ART is a perfect alternative
treatment approach for dental caries in the developing countries, whereas
mentioned earlier quite often carious teeth go untreated and eventually have
to be extracted.
1
The two main principles of ART are:
Removing carious tooth tissue using hand instruments only
Restoring the cavity with a glass ionomer
The reasons for using hand instruments rather than electric driven
handpieces are:
It makes restorative care accessible to all population groups.
The use of a biological approach, which requires minimal cavity
preparation that conserves sound tooth tissues and causes less
trauma to the teeth.

=== PAGE 916 ===
□
□
The low cost of hand instruments compared to electrically
driven dental equipment, the limitation of pain that reduces the
need for local anaesthesia to a minimum and reduces
psychological trauma to patients.
Simplified infection control; hand instruments can be easily
cleaned and sterilized after every patient.

=== PAGE 917 ===
Community Field Studies with ART
The ART approach was pioneered in Tanzania in the mid 1980s which was
then followed by several community field trials conducted in Thailand,
Zimbabwe and Pakistan in 1991, 1993 and 1995 respectively. Results of the
studies in Thailand and Zimbabwe have shown that 71% and 85%
respectively of the ART restorations remained in the teeth after 3 years.
2

=== PAGE 918 ===
Glass-lonomer as a Restorative Material in ART
They are available as a powder and liquid that has to be mixed together.
Since they chemically (not mechanically) bind to the teeth, the need to cut
sound tooth tissue to prepare the cavity is reduced. These materials continue
to release fluoride after setting which has the added advantage of arresting
and preventing caries around the restorations. Glass-ionomers are harmless to
dentine and pulp tissues. However, compared with other materials, glass-
ionomers are not strong enough and are currently being improved by the
manufacturers.

=== PAGE 919 ===
Instruments and Materials Essential for Art
Only hand instruments are needed to perform ART. These are—mouth
minors, explorers, pair of tweezers, spoon excavators, hatchets or hoes and
carvers. A mixing-pad and spatula are also necessary to mix the filling
material. Only a few other materials are needed—cotton wool rolls and
pellets, petroleum jelly to protect the setting glass-ionomer filling, plastic
strips to shape the restorations and wedges to hold the plastic strips to the
teeth (

Future Applications of Art
As ART is based on modern concepts of cavity preparation where minimal
intervention and invasion is emphasised, this approach is applicable also in
the industrialized countries for special groups such as the physically and
mentally handicapped and the elderly. ART is a friendly procedure where no
electric drills or anaesthetic injections are necessary that it can be used for
children and fearful adults.

=== PAGE 928 ===
Indications and Contraindications for ART
In general ART is carried out only in the cavities (involving dentine) and in
those that are accessible to hand instruments.
ART is not used when
There is an abscess (swelling) near the carious tooth. The pulp of the tooth is
exposed. Carious cavity not reachable with hand instruments.

=== PAGE 929 ===
Conclusions
ART is NOT a compromise but a perfect alternative treatment approach for
developing countries and special groups in the industrialized world.
ART is a biological approach which requires minimal cavity preparation
that conserves sound tooth tissues and causes less trauma to teeth.
As ART is painless the need for local anaesthetics are reduced and so is
the psychological trauma to patients.
Simplifies infection control as hand instruments can easily be cleaned and
sterilized.
No electrically driven and expensive dental equipment needed which
enables ART to be practised in remote areas and in the field.
ART approach is very cost effective since it is a friendly procedure, there
are great potentials for its use among children, fearful adults, physically and
mentally handicapped and the elderly.
It makes restorative care more accessible for all population groups.

Fluorides in
Caries Prevention
Fluorides play a pivotal role in the prevention of dental caries. It is the most
effective and most extensively tested of current anti-caries agents. The
natural occurrence, metabolism, mechanism of action and toxicology has
been thoroughly studied as any other element. It is one of the best
armamentariums used in the prevention and control of dental caries.

=== PAGE 932 ===
NATURAL OCCURRENCE OF FLUORIDE
Fluorides in Minerals and Earth’s Crust
Fluoride is an extremely reactive member of the halogen group of elements.
Fluoride is widely distributed in the earth’s crust. It is the 13
th
 most prevalent
element and is found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks.
In nature, fluorine occurs most abundantly in association with the
elements calcium, as fluorite or fluorspar, CaF
2
; calcium and phosphorus, as
fluoroapatite, Ca
10
(PO
4
)
6
F
2
; and aluminium as in cryolite Na
3
AIF
6
. Fluorides
occur in certain silicate minerals (topaz and lepidolite) as a result of
isomorphous replacement of the hydroxyl by fluoride ion, which is about the
same size and bears the same charge.
Fluorides in Water
By virtue of dissolution, fluorides occur in most springs, wells, seawaters,
and plants. The ubiquitous presence of fluorides in nature makes it an
inevitable component of human diet. Fluorides are present in trace quantities
in all surface and underground waters. The concentration of fluorides is
negligible in rainwater and high in some lakes and wells. The fluorides
contained in drinking water is commonly the largest single contributor to the
daily fluoride intake.
5
Fluorides in Food
The fluorides in the soil are absorbed by plants to a degree determined mostly
by the type of plant and secondarily by the fluoride compounds in soil and
the moisture conditions. Plants are selective in the amount of fluoride they
absorb.
Seafood
Sardines, salmon, mackerel and other fish contain about 20 ppm of fluoride
on a dry weight basis. Seafood is rich in fluorine since the oceans contain
about 1 ppm of fluorine. The high fluoride level in fish is attributed to the
fluoride in the skins and in bones, which become edible during canning.

=== PAGE 933 ===
Shellfish, or the flesh from large fish, contains only about 1 ppm of fluoride.
6
Rock Salt
The fluorine content of rock salt ranges between 40 and 200 ppm. In India,
this form of salt may be consumed at maximum intake of 20 g daily. These
source alone could supply between 1 and 4 mg fluoride to the daily diet and
this may contribute to the endemic fluorosis in some parts of India.
Tea
The tea plant family theaceae, including tea and camellias, stores fluoride.
Dried tea leaves contain about 100–400 ppm fluoride. An average infusion of
tea contains between 1.4 and 3.6 ppm fluorides.
Leafy Plants
The normal levels of fluoride in plants other than in tea family is about 2–20
microgram/gram of dry weight. Leafy vegetables, such as cabbage and
lettuce, contain about 11–26 microgram fluoride.
5
Plants grown in acidic soils have a higher fluoride content than those
grown in lime-containing basic soils.
Airborne Fluoride Emissions
Fluoride emissions are heaviest in the vicinity of industries involved in the
production of aluminium from cryolite or phosphate fertilizers. Airborne
fluoride in such areas occurs as particulate dusts, as hydrofluoric acid or
gaseous fluorine.
Fluorides in Drinks
Fresh fruit juices have a low fluoride content of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/litre. Human
breast milk has a low fluoride content, less than 0.02 mg/litre. The fluoride
content in soft drinks and mineral water reflects the same level as the water
from which it is produced.
Beer is normally low in fluorides ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 mg/litre, in
contrast to wine that can have fluoride levels of the order of 6–8 mg/litre.

=== PAGE 934 ===
Fluorides in Pharmaceutical Products
An increasing number of pharmaceutical products contain fluorides in
organic and inorganic form. The products such as sodium fluoride tablets,
vitamin pills, fluoride dentifrice, fluoride gels and solution are widely used
for caries prevention.

=== PAGE 935 ===
Metabolism of Fluoride
 (
Fig. 21.1
)
The significance of fluoride in nutrition is related to its regular presence in
small amounts in foods and in all tissues of the body. The advent of water
fluoridation as a public health measure for partial reduction of caries and the
continued and increasing use of other fluoride formulations makes it essential
that its metabolism be known. By understanding the fate of ingested fluoride
it is possible to quantitate safe and unsafe levels of ingestion from air, water
and foods.
6
Fig. 21.1:
 Metabolism of fluoride
2
Estimated Daily Intake of Fluoride
Several estimates have been made of the daily intake of fluoride from food
and water. The variation reflects different dietary patterns between races and
countries. Two factors that contribute most to the daily intake are fluoridated
water and fluoride-rich foods such as fish. The average daily intake of
fluoride by adults from dry food substances is in the range of 0.2–1.8 mg and
the average daily intake from water containing 1.0 ppm fluoride is about 1.5
mg.The total daily intake for adults being in the 1.7–3.3 mg range.
5
Absorption of Fluoride

=== PAGE 936 ===
Most fluorides are absorbed rapidly and transported in the body and
subsequently excreted as the fluoride ion. About 86–97% of ingested fluoride
is absorbed. The main factors influencing absorption are species variation,
concentration of fluorides ingested, solubility and degree of ionization of the
compounds, and other dietary constituents, such as calcium, which may form
insoluble salts with fluoride. The rate of absorption increases with starvation
and presence of fats. The presence of calcium, magnesium and aluminium
decrease absorption. A comparison of rates of absorption of fluoride in milk
and water indicates a significant reduction in fluoride absorption from milk
during the first hour, but thereafter absorption continued at higher levels for
longer periods of time.
Fluoride in Blood Plasma
There is evidence that plasma fluoride levels increase slightly with age.
Plasma fluoride levels also increase in the presence of renal failure.
Human blood contains fluorine in both organically bound and inorganic
forms. It has been suggested that the former originates from the environment
and that it does not seem to be related to the inorganic fluoride content.
Almost all fluoride in plasma is in ionic form and is not bound to any
macromolecules. The plasma half-life of fluoride is reported to be 4–10
hours.
Blood plasma fluoride levels begin to rise about 10 minutes after
ingestion and reach maximum levels within 60 minutes. Dose level and
frequency of intake determine the steady state level of fluoride in plasma.

=== PAGE 937 ===
Excretion of Fluorides
Excretion by the gut and sweat glands
Fluorides are excreted through the kidney, the gut and the skin. Fluorides
have low solubility and therefore, low absorption is excreted via the gut.
Sweat and insensible perspiration may account for an appreciable loss of
fluorine from the body. The concentration of fluoride in sweat is in the range
of 0.067–0.5 ppm under normal conditions of intake.
Renal Clearance of Fluoride
The normal kidney will efficiently eliminate about 50% of fluoride, which is
presented to it by glomerular filtration. It does not have access to all the
fluoride to which an individual has been exposed.
Fluoride in Osseous Tissue
Fluoride ions have an affinity for skeletal mineral and can be incorporated in
it during growth of the skeleton. Even in the absence of growth, it is
ultimately incorporated by replacement of hydroxyl ions in the mineral of
bone, hydroxyapatite.
Fluoride concentrations in bone tissue depend upon the amount of
fluoride ingested in food and water, and to a lesser extent, the amount inhaled
in air and on the length of time the individual has ingested fluoride. The
fluoride can be deposited in either the (1) adsorbed layer of the bone (2)
crystal structure (3) possibly bone matrix. The amount of fluoride that is not
stored in bone is rapidly excreted through kidneys.
Distribution and Deposition of Fluoride in NonOsseous
Tissues
Fluoride in blood is rapidly transferred, at rates of 30–40 %/minute to the
extracellular fluid component. Approximately 96% of the fluoride retained in
the animal body are found in bones and teeth, leaving a small quantity in soft
tissues. Fluoride is a bone seeker and accumulates in other tissues that
contain calcium. The ingestion of water containing negligible concentration
to 4.0 ppm fluoride does not result in the accumulation of fluoride in the

=== PAGE 938 ===
heart, liver, lung or spleen.
Fluoride Transfer by Placenta
The presence of fluoride in primary teeth that develop during the intrauterine
phase and the rapid increase in fluoride level of fetal blood when medications
containing fluoride are administered to pregnant women indicate that
fluorides readily cross the placenta. The skeletal fluoride increases with fetal
age in areas that have water supplies of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 ppm.

=== PAGE 939 ===
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Colorado Stain
The man who had the greatest impact on the early history of water
fluoridation was Dr Frederick McKay who arrived in Colorado Springs,
Colorado in 1901. He noticed that many of his patients, particularly those
who had lived in the area all their lives, had an apparently permanent stain on
their teeth which was known to the local inhabitants as ‘Colorado stain’. He
called the stain ‘mottled enamel’ and said that it was characterized by, minute
white flecks, or yellow or brown spots or areas, scattered irregularly or
streaked over the surface of a tooth, or it may be a condition where the entire
tooth surface is of a dead paper-white, like the colour of a china dish.
4
McKay approached one of America’s foremost authorities on dental
enamel, Dr Greene Vardiman Black, Dean of the North Western University
Dental School in Chicago. At first, Black thought that McKay was mistaking
the stain for something else. Black asked that some of the mottled teeth be
sent to him for examination and also agreed to attend the Colorado State
Dental Association meeting in July 1909.
In preparation for this visit, and as a first step in mapping out the entire
endemic area, McKay and a fellow townsman, Dr Isaac Binton, examined the
children in the public schools of Colorado Springs. In all, they inspected
2945 children and discovered to their complete astonishment that 87.5
percent of the children native to the area had mottled teeth.
This new information was given to Black when he arrived in Denver in
June 1909. Black addressed the State Dental Association meeting and Black’s
histological findings were published in a paper. “An endemic imperfection of
the enamel of the teeth heretofore unknown in the literature of dentistry”.
In 1912 McKay discovered that people from parts of Naples in Italy also
had stained teeth. He came across an article written in 1902 by Dr JM Eager,
a United States Marine Hospital Service Surgeon stationed in Italy, who
reported that a high proportion of certain Italian emigrants embarking at
Naples had a dental peculiarity known locally as denti di chiaie (Eager 1902).
McKay requested a young doctor, Dr JF McCounell from Colorado
Springs, to examine some Naples children and report back. The doctor was

=== PAGE 940 ===
familiar with the stain in Colorado Springs and wrote back, from Naples that
there was no doubt that the mottled teeth in Naples were the same as those
being investigated by McKay.

=== PAGE 941 ===
Mottled Enamel—Aetiological Factors
In the forefront of McKay’s mind all the time was the desire to determine the
cause of mottled enamel.
Further evidence supporting the water supply hypothesis came from a
dentist, Dr OE Martin, practicing in Britton, South Dakota. On reading
McKay’s 1916 article in Dental Cosmos, he felt that McKay’s description of
mottling sounded suspiciously like the blemishes he had seen in certain local
children and asked for McKay’s advice. McKay visited Britton in October
1916. He discovered that in 1898 Britton had changed its water supply from
individual shallow wells to a deep-drilled artesian well. Without exception,
McKay found that all those who had passed through childhood prior to the
changing of the water supply had normal teeth, while natives who had grown
up in Britton since 1898 had mottling. He concluded that some mysterious
element in the water supply was responsible (McKay 1918).
A similar occurrence was reported in the town of Bauxite. The first
domestic water supply to Bauxite came from shallow wells and springs, but
in 1909 deep well water was obtained. They found that no mottling occurred
in people who grew up on Bauxite water prior to 1909, but all native Bauxite
children who used the deep well water after that date had mottled teeth.
Another piece of evidence had been gathered, but McKay seemed no closer
to the solution.

=== PAGE 942 ===
Mottled Enamel and Fluoride Concentration in the
Drinking Water
In New Kensington, Pennsylvania, the Chief Chemist of ALCOA, Mr HV
Churchill, read McKay’s paper and was greatly disturbed. He asked McKay
to send samples of water from other endemic areas with a “minimum of
publicity”. The results showed that in all these areas the fluoride levels were
very high.
The sustained work of McKay was then rewarded in 1931 when
“fluorine” the element in drinking water which had evaded him for thirty
years was thus established to be the cause of enamel mottling.
Trendley H Dean was assigned the job to continue McKay’s work and to
find out the extent of geographical distribution of mottled enamel in the
United States (Shoe Leather Survey) Dean established that concentration of
fluoride in drinking water was directly correlated with severity of fluorosed
enamel. Thus Dean also developed a standard classification of mottling—
mottling index. Dean in 1936 presented additional evidence to show that
fluoride up to 1 ppm in drinking water was not hazardous to public health.
Dean also observed that in children taking 0.6 and 1.5 ppm, only 4–5 %
were caries free while those who used 1.7–2.5 ppm 22% were caries free. He
concluded that there is possibility in controlling dental caries through
domestic water supplies containing fluoride.
A series of studies conducted in the USA revealed that in areas with water
supplies containing no fluoride, DMFT ranged from 6–10 and in those areas
containing 1 ppm of fluoride, the DMFT ranged between 2 and 3.
Thus the above series of findings contributed factual information on the
beneficial role of fluorides on dental caries which paved the way towards
implementation of water fluoridation as a public health measure globally.

SYSTEMIC FLUORIDES
Water Fluoridation
Definition
Fluoridation is “the upward adjustment of the fluoride ion content of a
domestic water supply to the optimum physiologic concentration that will
provide maximum protection against dental caries and enhance the
appearance of the teeth with a minimum possibility of producing
objectionable enamel fluorosis”.
1
Optimum levels
The optimum fluoride level for water in temperate climate is 1 ppm. For
warmer and colder climates the amount can be adjusted from approximately
0.7 ppm to 1.2 ppm, adapted in accord with the amount of water consumed.
A concentration of 1 part per million (ppm) amount to 1 mg of fluoride per
litre (1 mg/litre).
9
Historical juncture
A great forward stride in the era of preventive dentistry was ushered with the
epidemiologic studies of the 1930s sponsored by the United States Public
Health Service and directed by Dr TH Dean.
The evidence regarding the safety of water fluoridation was so
convincing that the US Public Health Service took the major step in
artificially water fluoridating the water supply of Grand Rapids at 1 ppm on
25
th
 January 1945. Muskegon town was kept as a control town. The town was
to serve as a control town for 15 years. It did not. After 6 years the caries
experience in Grand Rapids was half that of Muskegon and it ceased to be a
control town.
The other communities that fluoridated their water supplies are as
follows.

Equipment and chemicals for fluoridation
The choice of equipment and of fluorides to be used will depend on
Costs and installation
Maintenance
Surveillance
The following general characteristics of the system need to be considered:
The equipment must be adapted to local conditions and needs of water
network.
Equipment must be efficacious, safe and precise.
Should have well defined precision limits.
Types of equipment
Saturator system
Dry feeder
Solution feeder
Venturi fluoridator system
Saturation-suspension cone
Fluorides used
Sodium fluoride (NaF):
Used in saturator system to avoid obstruction of gravel bed.
Used in granular form.
Available in 45 kg bags.
Expensive.
Sodium silico fluoride
:

transporting liquids.
Benefits of water fluoridation
Appearance of teeth
:
 Teeth exposed to an optimum or slightly higher
level of fluoride frequently are clear, white, shining, opaque and
without blemishes (
Fig. 21.2
).
Fig. 21.2:
 As the fluoride content of water increases beyond 1 ppm, the index
of fluorosis accelerates more rapidly than the DMF decreases
Dental caries reduction in primary and permanent teeth
:
 The
reduction for caries for primary teeth was between 40 and 50% and the
reduction for permanent teeth was between 50 and 60 % (
Fig. 21.3
).

Fig. 21.3:
 Study reported by Murray JJ and Rugg-Gunn of 94 community
fluoridation studies in 20 countries
Root caries
:
 A report by Stamm and Banting shows that life long
consumption of fluoridated water reduces the incidence of root caries
by approximately 50%.
Tooth loss
:
 According to Arnold FA, there is a 75% reduction in the
prevalence of extracted first molars in fluoridated areas compared with
those that are non-fluoridated.
Malocclusion
:
 According to Salzman, orthodontic problems are
approximately 20% less prevalent among children 6–14 years of age
living in a fluoride area compared to those living in areas without the
benefits of fluorides. This difference is possibly due to fact that the loss
of first permanent molars is minimal in fluoride area.
Interproximal and coronal caries
:
 There is about 95% less prevalence
of interproximal dental caries and a reduction of 60% coronal caries in
fluoridated communities compared to those of non-fluoridated.
Economy
:
 Among other means of fluoride usage—fluoride tablets,
school dentifrices, prescription fluorides, water fluoridation is most
economical in reducing the cost of public health expenditure.
Feasibility
Water fluoridation procedure is feasible only if
There is a municipal water supply reaching a reasonable number of

=== PAGE 948 ===

homes.
People drink this water rather than water from individual wells or
rainwater tanks.
Suitable equipment is present.
Supply of fluoride is assured.
Workers available in the water treatment plant to maintain the system
and keep records.
Money should be available for initial installation and running costs.
Fluoridation is feasible but is not implemented for political reasons. In
view of the good results achieved in those countries where it has been used
extensively for many years, water fluoridation must always be considered as
a public health measure. Not only it is safe, but water fluoridation is also by
far the most effective and efficient method of bringing the benefits of a
continuous low concentration of fluoride to a whole community.
The reasons for rejecting a proven benefit could be
Ignorance and confusion on the part of the public about the dental
health benefits.
Ambivalence of the public towards science and its by-products.
Misrepresentation of the scientific and technical information
involved.
School water fluoridation
: It was first initiated as a pilot study in 1954 at
St. Thomas Virgin Islands, United States. One of several effective
alternatives for prevention of dental caries in children of communities where
water fluoridation is not feasible is the fluoridation of the school water
supply. It can be used only if the surrounding areas from which the students
come have a low fluoride content. Consolidated schools are ideal since all
grades are housed in the same building.
7
The concentration of fluoride in the school water system is 4.5 ppm in
contrast to 1 ppm of community water supply. This upward adjustment is to
compensate for the reduced water intake since the school day and year is
shorter, hence the time spent at school.
The greatest advantage of school water fluoridation is that no effort is
required by the recipient. A reduction in DMFT of about 40% was observed
in children who drank fluoridated water containing 5 ppm.

Problems
Any effort to fluoridate the school system is subject to possible
confrontation by antifluoridation groups.
The cost of the installation, supplies and maintenance competes with
other needs of the school budget.
Custodial and back up personnel must be trained and used for continual
operation, maintenance and monitoring of the unit.
The major concern however is by age 6 all teeth except 3
rd
 molars are
in an advanced stage of mineralization, thus reducing the pre-eruptive
benefits of fluoride.
Salt Fluoridation
Salt fluoridation appears to be the most effective method to deliver fluoride to
a target population where water fluoridation is not possible, and avoiding the
firestorm of anti-fluoridationist opposition.
6
This program was first introduced in Switzerland in 1955, with 5 mg of
potassium iodine and 90 mg of sodium fluoride per kg.
Method of preparation
Type 1
: Fluoride is added to salt by spraying concentrated solutions of
sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride on salt on a conveyor belt.
Type 2
:
 Sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride are first mixed with slightly
moist salt or mixed with a flow conditioner such as tricalcium phosphate and
these premixed granules are added to the dry salt.
Advantages
The possibility of fluorosis is minimal.
It is safe.
Low cost.
Individual monitoring not required.
Freely available.
Distribution can be easily monitored.

=== PAGE 950 ===
7.
8.
1.
2.
Supply can be effectively controlled.
Readily accepted—as the addition of fluoride does not alter colour.
Disadvantages
There is no precise control, as the salt intake varies greatly among
people.
There is now international efforts to reduce sodium intake to help
control hypertension.
Milk Fluoridation
Milk is a reasonable vehicle for fluoride since it is a food used universally by
infants, pregnant women and children. Milk is an excellent source of calcium
and phosphorous and when fortified with vitamin D, contains all essentials
for the development of bones and teeth (
Figs 21.4
 and 
21.5
).
Fig. 21.4:
 Distribution of fluoridated milk

Fig. 21.5:
 Drinking fluoridated milk
Fluoridation of milk was first mentioned by Ziegler in 1956. The rate of
absorption of fluoride from milk and water indicates a significant reduction in
fluoride absorption from milk during the first hour, but thereafter absorption
continues at higher levels for longer periods of time. When milk is
fluoridated, most of the fluoride persists in the ionized form for the first 4
hours, thereafter, about one-fifth is bound to calcium and protein.
9
Advantage
Staple food for children and infants.
Disadvantages
Cost of fluoridated milk would be considerably higher.
Centralized milk supply should exist.
Variation in intake and quantity of milk.
Fluoride Tablets
Fluoride tablets provide systemic effect before mineralization of primary and
permanent dentition and a topical effect thereafter.
Effect on deciduous teeth
:
 When fluoride administration in the form of
tablets was started before 2 years of age and continued for a minimum of 3–4
years, caries reductions in the range of 50–80% have been reported.
3

=== PAGE 952 ===
Effect on permanent teeth
:
 Majority of the studies showed from no
marginal reduction to 20–40% caries reduction. Fluoride must be ingested
systemically in order to exert maximum cariostatic effects during the
mineralization of the surface of a crown.
Availability
:
 Fluoride tablets are commercially available as NaF tablets of
2.2 mg, 1.1 mg and 0.55 mg yielding 1 mg, 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg fluoride
respectively (
Fig. 21.6
).
Fig. 21.6:
 Commercially available fluoride tablets
Sodium fluoride tablets with vitamin combinations are also available. For
best topical effect, fluoride tablets should be first chewed and then
swallowed.
Swish and swallow technique
:
 With the use of tablets, it seemed logical
that if a child would chew the tablets, then swish the saliva between the teeth
for a minute before swallowing, both a topical and a systemic dosage of
fluoride would be achieved. This swish and swallow method is advocated
whenever tablets are used.
Recommended dose
:
 The daily recommended dose of fluoride for child
below 2 years is 0.5.mg, between 2 and 3 years is 0.5–0.7 mg and above 3
years is 1.0–1.5 mg.

=== PAGE 953 ===
1.
2.
3.
Fluoride tablets are commercially available as NaF tablets of 2.2. 1.1 and
0.5 mg respectively yielding 1, 0.5, and 0.25 mg fluoride respectively.
Advantages
Ready for use.
Requires a little time to dispense.
Some tablets have a flavour that enhances child motivation to
participate in the daily ingestion of fluoride tablet.
Fluoride Drops
Fluoride drops are used to supplement fluoride intake until a child is old
enough to swallow fluoride tablets.
Drops are usually administered by use of a plastic dropper bottle, where
10 drops equal 1 mg of fluoride. When 10 drops are placed in a litre of water
containing no fluoride, there is a resultant concentration of 1 ppm of fluoride
(1 mg/ml).
The use of drops can be expected to produce a caries reduction on the
order of 40%. Parents should be cautioned to use the prescribed number of
drops and not to assume that just because one drop is effective, two will be
better.

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF SYSTEMIC
FLUORIDES
The cariostatic mechanism of systemic fluorides can be explained under the
following headings:
Rendering enamel more resistant to acid dissolution
Inhibition of bacterial enzyme systems—enzymatic action
By reducing tendency of the enamel surfaces to absorb proteins.
Modification in the size and shape of teeth.

=== PAGE 955 ===
1.

3.
Rendering Enamel More Resistant to Acid Dissolution
Enamel contains millions of rods that run from dentino enamel junction to the
tooth surface. Each rod is made up of crystals which are hexagonal in shape
which is flattened on two opposite sides. Each crystal has three axis. The
cental position is occupied by the hydroxyl ion surrounded by calcium and
peripherally by phosphate ions. This model shows the steric configuration.
According to the laws of chemistry, in order to maintain symmetry, hydroxyl
ions must be located on side of the calcium plane as often as on the other.
Moreover, neutron diffraction studies have shown that two adjacent calcium
ions planes cannot have two hydroxyls between them. When such an
orientation of hydroxyl groups occurs, a steric interference occurs. To avoid
this steric interference one of the hydroxyl ions gets exterminated creating a
void or reversal points. Presence of such voids in crystal structure leads to
greater chemical reactivity making it highly reactive, thereby increases its
solubility.
6
Fluoride incorporates into the voids forming fluoroapatite as per the
following formula.

The other mechanisms which have been postulated in rendering decreased
enamel solubility in addition to void replacement are:
Under the influence of fluoride, large crystals are formed with fewer
imperfections, thus stabilizing the lattice and presenting a smaller
surface area/unit volume for dissolution.
Enamel which mineralizes under the influence of fluoride has a lower
carbonate content, thus giving a reduced solubility.
Fluoride brings about remineralization of the enamel at 1 ppm in early
carious lesions.

=== PAGE 956 ===
1.
2.
Enzymatic Action
Fluoride is found in two forms, bound and ionic. The bound fluoride
represents a fluoride reservoir in that it can dissociate when acid is produced
by plaque organisms to make available much more ionic fluoride.
Fluoride has several different modes of action on bacterial metabolism:
The concentration of fluoride above 2 ppm in solution progressively
decreases transport or uptake of glucose or glucose analogues into cells
of oral streptococci.
When plaque has been depleted of its exogenous sugar supply, fluoride
inhibits metabolism of iodophilic polysaccharides by the
microorganisms present in plaque and also by salivary bacteria, thus
indirectly interfering with acid production.

=== PAGE 957 ===
Effects Mediated by Surface Absorption
According to this hypothesis, fluoride incorporated in enamel by substitution
of hydroxyl ions altered the surface charge or free energy and thus indirectly
alters the deposition of pellicle and subsequent plaque formation.

=== PAGE 958 ===
Effects Mediated by Tooth Morphology
Fluoride is believed to alter the tooth morphology, i.e. reduction in the cusp
height, fissure depth and increase in the fissure width, thus making teeth less
susceptible to caries.

=== PAGE 959 ===
TOPICAL FLUORIDES
Definition
Topical fluoride therapy refers to the use of systems containing relatively
large, concentrations of fluoride that are applied locally, or topically, to
erupted tooth surfaces to prevent the formation of dental caries.

Sodium Fluoride: 2%
Method of preparation
Sodium fluoride solution can be prepared by dissolving 20 gm of sodium
fluoride powder in 1 litre of distilled water in a plastic bottle. If stored in
glass containers, the fluoride ion of solution can react with silica of glass
forming SiF
2
, thus reducing the availability of free active fluoride for
anticaries action.
Method of application (Knutson technique)
Initially, cleaning and polishing of the teeth is done.
An upper and opposing lower quadrant are isolated with cotton rolls.
Teeth are dried thoroughly.
2% NaF is applied with cotton applicators and is permitted to dry in the
teeth for about 4 minutes.
Procedure is repeated for the remaining quadrants.
After completion, patient is instructed to avoid eating, drinking or
rinsing for 30 minutes.
Second, third and fourth applications are done at weekly intervals.
Recommended ages
Full series of four treatments is recommended at ages 3, 7, 11 and 13.
Mechanism of action of sodium fluoride
When sodium fluoride is applied topically, it reacts with hydroxyapatite
crystals to form calcium fluoride which is the dominant product of reaction.
This is due to high concentration of fluoride (9,000 ppm) in 2% sodium
fluoride due to which the solubility product of calcium fluoride get exceeded
fast and this initial rapid reaction is followed by drastic reduction in its rate
and the phenomenon is called choking off.
Once a thick layer of calcium fluoride gets formed, it interferes with the
further diffusion of fluoride from the topical fluoride solution to react with
hydroxyapatite. Further calcium fluoride reacts with hydroxyapatite to form

=== PAGE 962 ===
1.
2.
fluoridated hydroxyapatite which increases the concentration of surface
fluoride, thus making the tooth structure more stable, less susceptible to
dissolution by acids, interferes with plaque metabolism through
antienzymatic action and also helps in remineralization of the initial
decalcified areas, thus showing its manifold anticaries effect.
Advantages
Accepted taste.
Stable if stored in plastic containers.
Disadvantage
Four visits relatively at short period of time.

Stannous Fluoride – 8%
Method of preparation (Muhler’s solution)
 Stannous fluoride solution has to
be freshly prepared before use each time as it has no shelf life. 0.8 gm of
stannous fluoride is dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water in a plastic container
and the solution thus prepared is shaken briefly. The solution is then applied
immediately to the teeth. The 10 ml of solution should be sufficient to treat
the whole mouth of a single patient. If any remains, it should be discarded
and not used again.
7
Method of application
Each tooth surface must be cleaned and polished.
Teeth are isolated with cotton rolls and dried with compressed air.
Either a quadrant or half of the mouth can be treated at one time.
Freshly prepared 8% solution of SnF
2
 is applied continuously to the
teeth with cotton applicators.
Teeth are kept moist with solution for 4 minutes.
Re-application of solution to tooth is done every 15–30 seconds.
Recommended frequency
The recommended frequency of 8% SnF
2
 applications is once per year.
Mechanism of action
When stannous fluoride reacts with hydroxyapatite, in addition to fluoride,
the tin of stannous fluoride also reacts with enamel and new crystalline
product stannous tin trifluoro-phosphate which is more resistant to decay than
enamel is formed. It is due to this reason that always a freshly prepared
stannous fluoride solution should be used and the capsule of SnF
2
 should be
kept in air tight containers, otherwise the stannous form of tin gets oxidised
to stannic form, thus making the SnF
2
 inactive for anticaries action.
Stannous fluoride with hydroxyapatite shows mainly four end products.
Tin hydroxyphosphate
Tin trifluorophosphate

=== PAGE 964 ===
3.
4.
1.
2.
Calcium trifluorostannate
Calcium fluoride
Calcium fluoride so formed, further reacts with hydroxyapatite and small
fractions of flour—hydroxyapatite also gets formed. The other end product,
tin hydroxyphosphate gets dissolved in oral fluids and is responsible for the
metallic taste after topical application of stannous fluoride.
The main end product tin trifluorophos-phate is responsible for making
the tooth structure more stable and less susceptible to decay.
Advantage
Application required only once per year.
Disadvantages
Has to be prepared freshly each time before use.
Metallic taste.

Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride—1.23%
Method of preparation (Brudevolds solution)
It is prepared by dissolving 20 gm of sodium fluoride in 1 litre of 0.1 M
phosphoric acid. To this added is 50 percent hydrofluoride acid to adjust the
pH at 3.0 and fluoride-concentration at 1.23 percent.
4
APF gel
 (
Fig. 21.9
)
For the preparation of APF gel, a gelling agent methyl cellulose or
hydroxyethyl cellulose is to be added to the solution and the pH is to be
adjusted between 4 and 5.
Another form of APF for topical applications, namely thixotropic gels, is
also available. The term thixotropic denotes a solution that sets in a gel-like
state but is not a true gel. With application of pressure, thixotropic gels
behave like solutions; it has been suggested that these preparations are more
easily forced into the interproximal spaces than conventional APF gels.
A foam form of APF is also available. Laborartory studies indicate that
the amount of fluoride uptake in enamel after applications using the foam is
comparable to that observed with conventional APF gels and solutions.
7
Method of application
Oral prophylaxis.
Teeth are isolated with cotton rolls on both lingual and buccal sides.
Teeth are dried.
APF solution is continuously and repeatedly applied with cotton
applicators.
Teeth are kept moist for four minutes.
Recommended frequency
The recommended frequency of APF topical application is twice a year.

 Placement of gels
Mechanism of action
When APF is applied on the teeth, it initially leads to dehydration and
shrinkage in the volume of hydroxyapatite crystals which further on
hydrolysis forms an intermediate product called dicalcium phosphate
dihydrate (DCPD).
This DCPD is highly reactive with fluoride and starts forming
immediately when APF is applied and fluoride penetrate into the crystals
more deeply through the openings produced by shrinkage and leads to
formation of fluorapatite.
Advantages
No staining of tooth structure.

)
The two most commonly used varnishes are:
Duraphat (NaF varnish)
Fluorprotector (silane fluoride)
Composition
Fluorprotector is a colourless, polyurethane lacquer. The fluoride compound
is a difluorosilane-ethyl-difluorohydroxy, silane. The active fluoride available
is 7000 ppm. Duraphat is a sodium fluoride in varnish form containing 22.6
mg F/ml suspended in an alcoholic solution of natural organic varnishes. It is
available in bottles of 30 ml suspension containing 50 mg NaF/ml. The active
fluoride available is 22,600 ppm

Oral prophylaxis.
Teeth are dried.
Teeth are not isolated with cotton rolls as varnish being sticky has a
tendency to stick to cotton.
The application is done first on lower arch as saliva collects more
rapidly around it, and then on the upper arch.
Application of varnish is done with single tufted small brush.
After application, patient is made to sit with mouth open for four
minutes.
Patient is instructed not to rinse or drink anything at all for one hour
and not to eat anything solids but take liquids and semisolids only till
next morning.
Contact between varnish and tooth surfaces are needed to be
maintained for 18 hours for prolonged interaction between fluoride and
enamel.

Mechanism of action
When varnish is applied topically under controlled conditions, a reservoir of
fluoride ions gets build up around the enamel of teeth. Fluoride keeps on
slowly releasing and continuously reacting with the hydroxyapatite crystals
of enamel over a long period of time leading to deeper penetration of fluoride
and formation of fluorapatite.
Recommended dose
The recommended dose of 0.5 ml of duraphat for single application contains
11.3 mg F, and 0.5 ml of fluorprotector contains 3.1 mg F.

MI Varnish
MI varnish is a 5% sodium fluoride varnish that has a desensitizing action
when applied to tooth surfaces. MI varnish also contains RECALDENT™
(CPP-ACP): Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate. The
application leaves a film of varnish on tooth surfaces (
Fig. 21.18
).

Fluoride Dentifrices
The term dentifrice is derived from a latin word (dens – tooth, fricare – to
rub). The most commonly used fluoride dentifrices are sodium mono
fluorophosphates and sodium fluoride.
Mono fluorophosphates dentifrices are considered to be more
advantageous than NaF and SnF
2
 because it has
Neutral pH.
Greater stability to oxidation and hydrolysis.
Greater shelf life.
Increased availability of fluoride.
No staining of teeth.
Indications
Dental caries prevention
: Recommended for each patient as part of the
complete prevention program.
Caries – risk patients
:
 Patients with moderate to rampant dental caries
should be advised to brush several times each day with fluoride –
containing dentifrice.
Desensitization
:
 Certain dentifrices containing fluoride have
desensitizing properties.
Mechanism of action
There are two possible modes of action regarding caries inhibitory
mechanism of mono fluorophosphates. According to Erricsson, 1963, mono
fluorophosphates is deposited in the crystalline lattice and in subsequent
intracrystalline transposition, fluoride is released and replaces the hydroxyl
group to form fluorapatite.
The second mode of action attributes the anticariogenic activity due to
mono fluorophosphates as such and it may exchange with the phosphate
groups in the apatite crystals and this reaction is not competitive of fluoride.

Fluoride dentifrices are available as gels or pastes. Sodium fluoride and
sodium mono-fluorophosphates dentifrices are approved currently.
Recommended procedures
Select an approved fluoride containing dentifrice.
Place a small amount of dentifrice on the toothbrush tips.
Use only a small amount, the size of a pea.
Spread dentifrice over the teeth with a light touch of the brush.
Proceed with correct brushing for sulcular removal of bacterial plaque.
Keep dentifrice container out of reach of children.
Safety
Fluoride toothpaste generally contains around 800 to 1000 ppm of fluoride
and the free available fluoride is approximately 500 to 600 ppm, i.e. about 30
mg fluoride in a tube of 50 gm.
Recommendations for use of fluoride
For children below 4 years
: Fluoride toothpaste is not recommended.
For children 4–6 years
:
 Brushing once daily with fluoride toothpaste
and other two times without a paste.
For children 6–10 years
:
 Brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste
and once without paste.
For children above 10 years
:
 Brushing three times with fluoride
toothpaste.

Fluoride Mouth Rinses
 (
Table 21.1
)
Mouth rinsing is a practical and effective means for self-application of
fluoride. The only persons excluded from the practice of this method are
children under 6 years of age and those of any age who cannot rinse because
of oral-facial musculature problems or other handicap.
3
Table 21.1:
 
Composition and frequency of approved fluoride rinses
7
Method of preparation
The procedure of making a rinse everyday in home is by dissolving 200 mg
NaF tablet (10 mg NaF and rest the filler as lactose) in 5 teaspoons of fresh
clean water (25 ml approx.) which is sufficient for daily mouth rinse of a
family of about four members.
Method of use
Rinse daily with 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) after brushing before bed.
Swish between teeth with lips tightly closed for 60 seconds;
expectorate.
Fluoride rinses can be used as daily mouth rinse by community and
fortnightly in schools.
Advantage
30–40% average reduction in dental caries incidence.
Disadvantage
Requires community participation.

=== PAGE 978 ===
Multiple Fluoride Therapy
Multiple fluoride therapy describes fluoride combination programs.This
program included the application of fluoride in the dental office in the form
of both fluoride containing prophylactic paste and a topically applied fluoride
solution, in addition to self-care using an approved fluoride dentifrice. In
addition, some form of systemic fluoride, preferably community water
fluoridation was included.

=== PAGE 979 ===
Recent Advances in Fluoride Release
Controlled Release Fluoride
Observations have suggested that the sustained release of fluoride from an
intraoral device could be an approach for the control of dental caries in
special groups. Such a device has now been developed which consists of a
central depot of sodium fluoride intimately mixed with a plastic copolymer
and surrounded by a rate-controlling membrane. Fluoride diffuses out at a
rate that is controlled by the thickness of the membrane and the exposed
surface area of the device. Device can release fluoride at a rate of from 0.02
to 1 mg/day for up to six months.
2
All the available evidence shows slow release techniques could play a
major role in the prevention of dental caries. The devices could be
incorporated into space maintainers, orthodontic appliances, partial dentures,
crown and bridge work and of course directly on to the tooth surfaces.
Patients most likely to benefit from the use of these devices include those
who have salivary gland malfunction as a result of disease on radiation
therapy. The handicapped who are unable to carry out normal oral hygiene
procedures are also likely to be beneficiaries.

Chronic Fluoride Toxicity
On Enamel
The influence of chronic fluorine intoxication is on the structure of enamel in
the development of mottled enamel.
“Characterised by minute white flecks, yellow or brown spot areas,
scattered irregularly over the tooth surface”.
Thicker the enamel, higher the severity.
Fluorosis occurs symmetrically with in dental arches.
Premolar is the most affected.
Permanent teeth are particularly affected although occasional mottling
of primary teeth may also be seen.
Treatment of Mottled Teeth
Milder forms diminish with time.
Removing minor blemished stains by grinding or polishing and etching
by acid.

DEFLUORIDATION
The need to fluoridate water supplies to reduce dental caries is balanced by a
similar need to remove excessive amounts of fluorides from naturally
fluoridated waters. Defluoridation of water is more than 10 times as
expensive as fluoridation.

=== PAGE 987 ===
•
•
•
1.
2.
3.
Methods
The ideal method to defluoridate an area is to blend the water from the well
with the excess amount of fluoride with another water supply deficient in
fluoride.
This method is being used at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
Advantage
The only expenditure is the connecting pipes.
Disadvantage
It can be used only in areas where extremes in concentration exists.
Hence alternative chemical methods need to be used.
Additive Methods
In this method chemicals are added to precipitate the fluoride and then the
fluoride is passed through mixing basins, flocculation units, setting basins
and filtering beds.
9
Chemicals used
Lime (calcium oxide)
Magnesium compounds (dolomite)
Aluminium sulfate (alum)
Adsorption Method
The water rich in fluoride is run over contact beds, where the fluoride is
removed by ion exchange.
Chemicals used
Synthetic hydroxyapatite → Abandoned now due to high cost
Ion exchange resin → Too expensive
Activated alumina

=== PAGE 988 ===

Polystyrene → Fluoride removal capacity is lost on prolonged
use,unacceptable taste in water, and costly.
Defluoron – 1 → Attritional loss
Magnesia → High initial cost, large concentration required.
Indian Perspective
The deflouridation techniques required skilled operations and the chemicals
were expensive. Hence Nawlakhe in 1974 introduced the Nalgonda
technique.
Method
The chemicals lime, bleaching powder and filter alum is added in sequence to
the fluoride water. The water is then passed through the flocculation,
sedimentation and filtration chambers.
Chemicals
Lime or sodium aluminates → hastens settlement of precipitate.
Bleaching powder → disinfection.

=== PAGE 989 ===
FLUORIDE BELTS
In our country, the states having some circumscribed areas of high fluoride
levels (endemic fluoride belts with F content in groundwater above 4.00
ppm) include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra
Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
In the north, areas with high fluoride content in natural waters constitute a
long endemic fluoride belt with fluoride content 1.1–21.0 ppm starting from
north west Delhi to Sirsa and Hissar in Haryana, a part of Sangrur district
including Barnala, almost whole of Bhatinda districts in Punjab and
Rajasthan.
The high fluoride areas in Gujarat are Kutch and western Jamnagar
districts (F levels in groundwater between 4 and 8.0 ppm).
The areas in Tamil Nadu with fluoride levels between 1.5 and 5.0 ppm
are Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, North Arcot, Salem, Tiruchirapalli, Madurai,
etc.
The arid and semi-arid belts of western India have a few villages with
water fluoride levels as high as 9.5, 8.5, 8.5 and 19.0 ppm respectively.
Usually, without the scientific background of realistic data on the fluoride
content of drinking water, a casual remark is often made that India already
has a high concentration of fluoride in drinking water. Only about 5% of
population lives in high fluoride areas or known endemic fluoride belts.
For example
,
Biharsharif area in Bihar,
Bhatinda belt in Punjab,
Etawah area in Uttar Pradesh.
Anantpur and Guntakal areas in
Andhra Pradesh

FLUORIDE ALTERNATIVES
In recent years, alternatives to fluoride such as theobromine, nano
hydroxyapatite (HA) casein phosphopeptide (CPP), etc. have been proposed
for their anti-cariogenic properties.

=== PAGE 991 ===
Theobromine Containing Dentifrices
 (

Applied Biostatistics and
Research Methodology

=== PAGE 999 ===
INTRODUCTION
The increasing amount of research in the dental field and the active
participation of students in research have deemed the need to understand
basic statistics and research methodology principles. The goal of this chapter
is to give the reader a conceptual understanding of the basic statistical
procedures used in the health sciences. Emphasis is given to the rationales,
applications, and interpretations of the most commonly used statistical
techniques rather than on their advanced mathematical, computational and
theoretical aspects.

TERMINOLOGIES
1
,
2
Statistics
Statistics can be defined as the science of collecting, summarizing,
presenting, analyzing and interpreting the data.
Biostatistics
Biostatistics deals with the statistical methodologies involved in biological
sciences. As medicine is a branch of biology, medical statistics is a branch of
biostatistics.
Statistical Inference
Statistical inference makes use of information from a sample to draw
conclusions (inferences) about the population from which the sample was
taken.
Experiment
An experiment is any process or study which results in the collection of data,
the outcome of which is unknown. In statistics, the term is usually restricted
to situations in which the researcher has control over some of the conditions
under which the experiment takes place.
Population
A population is any entire collection of people, animals, plants or things from
which we may collect data. It is the entire group we are interested in, which
we wish to describe or draw conclusions about.
Sample
A sample is a group of units selected from a larger group (the population). By
studying the sample, it is hoped to draw valid conclusions about the larger
group.
Sampling Unit

=== PAGE 1001 ===
1.
A unit is a person, animal, plant or thing which is actually studied by a
researcher; the basic objects upon which the study or experiment is carried
out. For example, a person; a monkey; a sample of soil; a pot of seedlings; a
postcode area; a doctor’s practice.
Sampling Distribution
The sampling distribution describes probabilities associated with a statistic
when a random sample is drawn from a population. The sampling distribution
is the 
probability distribution
 or 
probability density function
 of the statistic.
Parameter
A parameter is a value, usually unknown (and which, therefore, has to be
estimated), used to represent a certain population characteristic. For example,
the population mean is a parameter that is often used to indicate the average
value of a quantity. Within a population, a parameter is a fixed value which
does not vary. Each sample drawn from the population has its own value of
any statistic that is used to estimate this parameter. For example, the mean of
the data in a sample is used to give information about the overall mean in the
population from which that sample was drawn.
Statistic
A statistic is a quantity that is calculated from a sample of data. It is used to
give information about unknown values in the corresponding population. For
example, the average of the data in a sample is used to give information about
the overall average in the population from which that sample was drawn.
Estimate
An estimate is an indication of the value of an unknown quantity based on
observed data. More formally, an estimate is the particular value of an
estimator that is obtained from a particular sample of data and used to
indicate the value of a parameter.
Uses of statistics

To measure the state of health of community and to identify its health
problems, their nature, etc.

To evaluate progress and development of disease.
Statistics helps the dentist to think quantitatively and to be able to
assess probabilities.
It helps in estimating the future needs of the community and to fix
suitable targets for achievement.

DATA
3
,
4
Data are a set of values of one or more variables recorded on one or more
individuals. Data consist of discrete observations of attributes or events that
carry little meaning when considered alone. Data need to be transformed into
information by reducing, summarizing and adjusting them for variations in
the age and sex composition of the population so that comparisons over time
and place are possible.

Types of Variable
Numerical discrete
:
 A discrete variable is a random variable that can
take on a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of
values.
For example, the number of teeth with restorations, the number of
patients with premalignant lesions, the number of patients requiring
ART.
Numerical continuous
:
 A continuous variable is a random variable
that can take on a range of values on a continuum; that is, its range is
uncountably infinite.
For example, treatment time, pocket depth, amount of new bone
deposition.

PRESENTATION OF DATA

The variables distributed in a population or a sample can be of interest for
various reasons. Statistical data once collected must be arranged purposively,
in order to bring out the important points clearly and strikingly. Therefore,
the manner in which statistical data is presented is of utmost importance.
There are several methods of presenting data.
Tabulation
Simple tables
Frequency distribution table

Tabulation
Tables are devices for presenting data. Tabulation is the first step before the
data is used for analysis or interpretation. There are general principles that
should be borne in mind before designing tables.
The tables should be numbered, e.g. 
Tables 22.1
 to 
22.3
, etc.
A title must be given to each table. The title must be brief and self-
explanatory.
The headings of columns and rows should be clear and concise.
The data must be presented according to size or importance
chronologically, alphabetically or geographically.
If percentage or average are to be compared, they should be placed as
close as possible.
No table should be too large.
Foot notes may be given, where necessary, providing explanatory notes
or additional information.

Frequency distribution table

The first step in summarizing data is to organize the data in some meaningful
fashion. The most convenient and commonly used method is a 
frequency
distribution
, in which raw data are organized in table form by class and

=== PAGE 1011 ===

6.
frequency. For nominal and ordinal data, a frequency distribution consists of
categories and the number of observations that correspond to each category.
Points to remember in formulating a frequency distribution table:
Select the number of non-overlapping intervals. The groups should not
be too broad or too narrow. For example, grouping of age should
neither be yearly or 30 yearly but have 5 or 3 yearly and the interval
should be uniform throughout.
The number of classes should neither be too many nor too low. It can
generally be anywhere between 6 and 16 depending on requisites of
study and the proposed sample size.
The actual number and percentages can be mentioned simultaneously
using parenthesis.
Groups should be tabulated in ascending or descending order, from the
lowest value in range to highest, such as height in centimetres 141–
150, 151–160, 161–170.
If certain data are to be omitted or excluded from the table, the reason
for the same should be mentioned in foot note.
The headings must be clear with measurement units, e.g. age in years,
rate in per cent or per thousand, etc.
Example of a frequency distribution table:

Charts and Diagrams

Although frequency distribution is an effective way to organize and present
data. Charts and diagrams can convey the same information more
interestingly.
Advantages
Diagrams are better retained in the memory than statistical tables.
If the diagrams are drawn simple, the impact on the reader is much
higher.
Disadvantages
Lots of details of the original data may be lost in charts and diagrams.

The height of a vertical bar represents the number of observations that fall
into a category (or a class). When two sets of data with an unequal number of
observations are being compared, the height of a vertical bar should represent
proportions or percentages.

Types of bar chart

1. 
Simple bar chart
Example
: Age-wise distribution of students in a school.
2. 
Multiple bar chart
When there are two sets of similar information they can be contrasted by
displaying both sets on the same graph, by using multiple bars. Similar to bar
diagram except that for each category of the variable we have set of bars of
the same width corresponding to the different sections without any gap in
between the width and length corresponds to the frequency.
Example
: Distribution of students according to gender and level of
graduation.
3. 
Percentage component bar chart
This can be used in a similar way as multiple bar chart. When it is desired to
compare only the proportion of subgroups between different major groups of
observations, then bars are drawn for each group with same length, either as 1
or 100%. These are then divided according to the subgroup proportion in
each major group.

=== PAGE 1015 ===
Example
: Distribution of students according to gender and level of
graduation.
4. 
Component bar chart
When it is desired to represent both, the number of cases in major groups as
well as the subgroups at the same time, we use the component bar diagram.
First, we draw rectangles proportional to the number of cases of the major
group. Then, each rectangle is divided according to the numbers in
subgroups.
Example
: Prevalence of dental caries age- and gender-wise.
5. 
Pie or sector diagram
6
It is a simple circle divided into pie-shaped pieces that are proportional in
size to the corresponding frequencies or percentages. Categorical data are
often presented graphically as a pie chart. The variable for pie charts can be
nominal or ordinal measurement scale. To construct a pie chart, the frequency
for each category is converted into a percentage. Then, because a complete
circle corresponds to 360 degrees, the central angles of the pieces are
obtained by multiplying the percentages by 3.6.

=== PAGE 1016 ===
Example
: Distribution of study subjects according to religion in a state.
6. 
Pictogram or picture diagram
It is a most preferred method when research data is to be projected to a
common man, such as mortality rates in case of a recent epidemic. The
reduction in number of road traffic accidents before and after making helmets
compulsory for two wheelers.
Example
: Approximate number of people who live in selected cities are:
London: 6 million
Paris: 2½ million
Berlin: 3 million
Rome: 2¼ million
Moscow: 8 million.
This data may be presented as a pictogram.

Map diagram or spot map
The geographical distribution of a characteristic or a frequency can be
represented by using this method. Scenarios like fluoride belts in the country,
primary health centres in the country can be denoted using map diagram or
spot map.
Example
: Worldwide distribution of child labour aged 10 to 14 years

Presentation of Quantitative Data
1. 
Histogram
A histogram is similar to bar graph except it uses interval or ratio variables
and is used to represent quantitative data. The variables under consideration
are grouped into intervals of equal width. Like a bar graph, rectangles are
drawn above each interval, and the height of the interval represents the
number of observations in the interval.
Points to be noted in histograms
6
Histograms serve as a quick and easy check of the shape of a
distribution of the data.
The construction of the graphs is subjective.
The shape of the histograms depends on the width and the number of
class intervals.
Histograms could be misleading. Histograms display grouped data.
Individual measurements are not shown in the graphs.
Histograms can adequately handle data sets that are widely dispersed.
The subjective nature of the histogram suggests that we must be
cautious about how we use histograms and not be enamoured with their
use.
Histograms should not be constructed with open class intervals. When
the width of the class intervals is not equal, special care should be
exercised.
Example
: Distribution of study subjects according to height in cm.

=== PAGE 1019 ===
2. 
Frequency polygon (a figure with many angels)
It is a diagram of frequency distribution drawn over a histogram. The
midpoints of class intervals at the height of frequencies are joined by straight
lines. It gives a polygon. Most commonly used when multiple sets of data are
to be represented in the same graph. For example, birth of heterozygous and
homozygous twins. When the number of observations is very large and group
interval is reduced, the frequency polygon tends to loose its angulation giving
place to a smooth curve known as frequency curve.
3. 
Line chart or graph
This diagram is useful to study changes of values in the variable over time
and is the simplest type of diagram. On the X axis, the time such as hours,
days, weeks, months, years is represented and the value of any quantity data
is represented along the Y axis.
Example
: Change in trend of dental caries over past 25 years.


=== PAGE 1020 ===
4. 
Scatter or dot diagram
It is prepared after tabulation in which frequencies of at least two variables
have been cross classified. It is a graphic presentation, made to show the
nature of correlation between two variable characters X and Y in the same
person or group such as height and weight in men aged 20 years, hence it is
also called correlation diagram. The characters are read on the base and the
vertical axes and the perpendiculars drawn from these readings meet to give
one scatter point. Varying frequencies of the characters give a number of
such points that show a scatter. A line is drawn to show the nature of
correlation.
Example
: Correlation between height and weight in 6 individuals.

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
3
,
4
For overall comparison of the distributions, the entire mass of data may be
summarized using a single value which is known as the parameter and one
such parameter is the measure of central tendency.
The 
main objective
 of measure of central tendency is:
To condense the entire mass of data.
To facilitate comparison.
Requisites of a good measure of central tendency:
It should be rigidly defined.
It should be simple to understand and easy to calculate.
It should be based upon all values of given data.
It should be capable of further mathematical treatment.
It should have sampling stability.
It should not be unduly affected by extreme values.
The most commonly used measures are as follows.

Mean
This measure implies the arithmetic average or arithmetic mean. It is obtained
by summing up all the observations and dividing the total by number of
observations.
For example, the following denotes the number of decayed teeth in 10
children.
Total = 36
Mean = 36/10 = 3.6 (mean decay in 10 children)
Mean is denoted by the sign X̅ (X bar)
Merits of Mean
It is rigidly defined.
It is easy to understand and easy to calculate.
It is based upon all values of the given data.
It is capable of further mathematical treatment.
It is not much affected by sampling fluctuations.
Demerits of Mean

It cannot be calculated for the data with open end classes.
It is affected by extreme values.
It cannot be located graphically.
It may be number which is not present in the data.
It can be calculated for the data representing qualitative characteristics.

Median
In median, the data are arranged in an ascending or descending order of
magnitude and the value of middle observation is located.
For example, number of decayed teeth in ten children.
Arrange them in ascending or descending order.
0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7
If there are only 9 observations excluding the 0 then median = 4.
Merits of Median
It is rigidly defined.
It is easy to understand and easy to calculate.
It is not affected by extreme values.
Even if extreme values are not known, median can be calculated.
It can be located just by inspection in many cases.
It can be located graphically.
It is not much affected by sampling fluctuations.
It can be calculated for data based on ordinal scale.
Demerits of Median
It is not based upon all values of the given data.
For larger data size, the arrangement of data in the increasing order is
difficult process.
It is not capable of further mathematical treatment.
It is insensitive to some changes in the data values.

Mode
The mode is the most frequent data value. Mode is the value of the variable
which is predominant in the given data series. Thus in case of discrete
frequency distribution, mode is the value corresponding to maximum
frequency. Sometimes there may be no single mode, if no one value appears
more than any other. There may also be two modes (bimodal), three modes
(trimodal), or more than three modes (multimodal).
For example, number of decayed teeth in children are as follows:
1. 0, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7
Here the mode is 4 (unimodal)
2. 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7
Here the mode is 3, 4 (bimodal).
Merits of Mode
It is easy to understand and easy to calculate.
It is not affected by extreme values or sampling fluctuations.
Even if extreme values are not known, mode can be calculated.
It can be located just by inspection in many cases.
It is always present within the data.
It can be located graphically.
It is applicable for both qualitative and quantitative data.
Demerits of Mode
It is not rigidly defined.
It is not based upon all values of the given data.
It is not capable of further mathematical treatment.

MEASURES OF DISPERSION
3
,
4
The scatteredness or variation of observations from their average is called the
dispersion. There are different measures of dispersion like range, quartile
deviation, mean deviation and standard deviation.
Main objective of measures of dispersion:
To study the variability of data.
Accounting the variability in data.
Requisites of a good measure of dispersion
:
 It carries the same requisites
as for measures of central tendency.
The most commonly used measure of dispersion is as follows.

=== PAGE 1026 ===
•

•
The Range
It is the simplest method, defined as the difference between the value of the
largest item and the value of the smallest item. This measure gives no
information about the values that lie between the extreme values. This
measure is simple to calculate.
For example, the plaque index score of 5 individuals is as follows: 1, 0, 0,
2, 3
Range = Xmax – Xmin
Range = 3 – 0 = 3
Range coefficient
= X
max
 – X
min
/X

min
3 – 0/3 + 0 = 1
Merits of Range
Simple
Easy to understand
Quickly calculated
Demerits of Range
Its value fluctuates with size of observation.
It is unstable in repeated sampling.
It is very rough measures of dispersion and not suitable for precise and
accurate studies.
It is of no practical importance because it does not indicate anything
about the dispersion of values between the two extreme values.

=== PAGE 1027 ===
•
•
•
Quartile Deviation
The quartiles are the values which divide the whole distribution into four
equal parts. We can delete the values below the first quartile and above the
third quartile. This quantity is known as quartile deviation.
QD
 —(Q3 —Q1)/2
Merits of Quartile Deviation
The quartile deviation is more stable than range.
This is not affected by two extreme values.
Demerits of Quartile Deviation
It fails to take all the values of deviation into account.

=== PAGE 1028 ===
•
•
•
•
•
Mean Deviation
It is the average of the deviation from the arithmetic mean. The mean
deviation is one way of measuring how closely the individual scores in the
data set cluster around the mean. This is done by (x—X bar).
Merits
The mean deviation takes all the values into consideration.
It is fairly stable compared to range or quartile deviation.
Demerits
It is not stable like standard deviation.
Mean deviation ignores signs of deviation.
It is not possible to use it for further statistical analysis.

=== PAGE 1029 ===
Standard Deviation (SD)
The standard deviation is the most frequently used measure of deviation. In
simple terms, it is defined as root mean square deviation. It is denoted by the
Greek letter Sigma or by the initials SD. It is an improvement over mean
deviation as a measure of dispersion and is used most commonly in statistical
analyses.
It is calculated in the following way; first the mean is calculated. Then the
difference of observations from the mean is made. This value is then squared
and the squared values are added to get the sum of squares. This sum is
divided by the number of observations minus one to get the mean square
deviation (variance). Find the square root of this variance to get the root mean
squared deviation, called standard deviation. Having squared the original,
reverse the step of taking square root.
(For samples more than 30)
For smaller samples, the above formula tends to underestimate the SD
and, therefore, needs correction which is done by substitution the
denominator (n —1) for n.
The modified formula is

Standard Error (SE)
It is the standard deviation of the population mean. It is an indication of the
reliability of the mean. A small SE is an indication that the sample mean is a
more accurate reflection of the actual population mean. A larger sample size
will normally result in a smaller SE (while SD is not directly affected by
sample size).
SD vs SE
Many researchers fail to understand the distinction between standard
deviation and standard error, even though they are commonly included in
data analysis. While the actual calculations for standard deviation and
standard error looks very similar, they represent two very different, but
complementary measures. SD tells us about the shape of our distribution,
how close the individual data values are from the mean value. SE tells us how
close our sample mean is to the true mean of overall population. Together,
they help to provide a more complete picture than the mean alone can tell us.
Merits of Standard Deviation
It is rightly defined.
It is based on all the observations of the series and hence it is
representative.
It is amenable to further algebraic treatment.
It is least affected by the fluctuations of sampling.
Demerits of Standard Deviation
It is more affected by extreme items.
It cannot be exactly calculated for a distribution with open-ended
classes.
It is relatively difficult to calculate and understand.

NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
4
When a large number of observations of any variable characteristic such as
height, blood pressure and pulse rate are taken at random to make them a
representative sample, a frequency distribution table is prepared. It will be
seen that:
Some observations are above the mean, and others are below the mean.
If they are arranged in order (plus or minus side of mean) maximum
number of frequencies will be seen in the middle around the mean and
fewer at the extremes, decreasing smoothly on both sides.
Normally almost half the observations lie above and half below the
mean and all observations are symmetrically distributed on each side of
mean.
A distribution of this nature or shape is called normal distribution or
Gaussian distribution.
It is useful to note at this stage that in a normal curve:
The area between one standard deviation on either side of mean (x̅ ± 1
SD)
 will include approximately 68% of the values in the distribution.
The area between two standard deviations, on either side of mean (
x̅ ±
2 
SD
) will include approximately 95 per cent values
The area between three standard deviation on either side of mean (
x̅ ±
 3
SD
) will include 99.7% of values.
These limits on either side of the mean are called confidence limits.

Characteristics of a Normal Curve

It is a smooth, symmetrical bell-shaped curve.
The total area of the curve is 1. Its mean zero and standard deviation 1.
The parameters mean, median and mode coincide at the centre
A maximum number of observations are at the centre and gradually
decrease towards the extremities on either side.

=== PAGE 1034 ===
CONFIDENCE
4
,
6
The confidence interval
 is the plus-or-minus figure usually reported in
newspaper or television opinion poll results. For example, if you use a
confidence interval of 4 and 47% of your sample picks an answer you can be
“sure” that if you had asked the question of the entire relevant population
between 43% (47 – 4) and 51% (47 + 4) would have picked that answer.
The confidence level
 tells you how sure you can be. It is expressed as a
percentage and represents how often the true percentage of the population
who would pick an answer lies within the confidence interval. The 95%
confidence level means you can be 95% certain; the 99% confidence level
means you can be 99% certain. Most researchers use the 95% confidence
level.
When you put the confidence level and the confidence interval together,
you can say that you are 95% sure that the true percentage of the population
is between 43% and 51%. The wider the confidence interval you are willing
to accept, the more certain you can be that the whole population answers
would be within that range. For example, if you asked a sample of 1000
people in a city which brand of cola they preferred, and 60% said Brand A,
you can be very certain that between 40 and 80% of all the people in the city
actually do prefer that brand, but you cannot be so sure that between 59 and
61% of the people in the city prefer the brand.

PROBABILITY
4
This topic has fascinated philosophers, mathematicians and gamblers for
hundreds of years. Probability is defined as possible or probable chances of
occurrence of an event or happening. Probability is a proportion. Its value
must, therefore, be between 0 and 1 or 0% and 100%.
In other words, it denotes the elative frequency of odds with which an
event is expected to occur on an average or in the long run. The main purpose
of selecting a representative sample is to know the probability of occurrence
of single or group of observations in a normal distribution of any biological
variable. To know the occurrence by chance in sample is to compare with the
population.
In tossing a coin, the only possible outcome is a head or a tail. Probability
of a head is 0.5 and tail is 0.5 and the sum is 1.
An impossible event has probability 0.
An event which must occur has probability 1.
The above 2 rules show that probability of any event is measured on a
scale from 0 to 1. There are a large number of theoretical probability
distributions. Among the most common is the normal distribution/normal
curve. In any test, a quantity P is found out which gives the probability that
the difference between the two groups is because of sampling variation. If
this probability is more than 0.05, the difference is called insignificant and if
it is less than or equal to 0.05, the difference is called as significant. This
value of P is obtained by calculating various tests of significance.
P < 0.001: Very highly significant.
P < 0.01: Highly significant.

=== PAGE 1036 ===
P < 0.05: Significant.
P > 0.05: Not significant.
Formula for calculating P: P = Number of events occurring/Total number
of trials

TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE
7
,
8
Two questions arise about any hypothesized relationship between two
variables:
What is the probability that the relationship exists?
If it does, how strong is the relationship?
There are two types of tools that are used to address these questions; the
first is by tests for statistical significance; and the second is addressed by
measures of association. Tests for statistical significance are used to address
the following questions:
What is the probability that we think is a relationship between two
variables is really just a chance of occurrence?
If we selected many samples from the same population, would we still
find the same relationship between these two variables in every
sample?
If we would do a census of the population, would we also find that this
relationship exists in the population from which the sample was
drawn? Or is our finding due only to random chance?
Statistical significance is not the same as practical significance. We can
have a statistically significant finding, but the implications of that finding
may have no practical application. The researcher must always examine both
the statistical and the practical significance of any research finding.

Steps in Testing for Statistical Significance
9
State the research hypothesis
State the null hypothesis
Select a probability of error level (alpha level)
Select and compute the test for statistical significance
Reporting tests of statistical significance
1. State the Research Hypothesis
A research hypothesis states the expected relationship between two variables.
It may be stated in general terms, or it may include dimensions of direction
and magnitude. For example,
General
: The length of the job training programme is related to the rate of
job placement of trainees.
Direction
: The longer the training programme, the higher the rate of job
placement of trainees.
Magnitude
: Longer training programmes will place twice as many
trainees into jobs as shorter programmes.
2. State the Null Hypothesis
A null hypothesis usually states that there is no relationship between the two
variables. For example, there is no relationship between the length of the job
training programme and the rate of job placement of trainees.
A null hypothesis may also state that the relationship proposed in the
research hypothesis is not true. For example, longer training programmes will
place the same number or fewer trainees into jobs as shorter programmes.
Researchers use a null hypothesis in research because it is easier to
disprove a null hypothesis than it is to prove a research hypothesis. It is easier
to show that something is false once than to show that something is always
true. It is easier to find disconfirming evidence against the null hypothesis
than to find confirming evidence for the research hypothesis.
3. Type I and Type II Errors

=== PAGE 1040 ===
Even in the best research project, there is always a possibility (hopefully a
small one) that the researcher will make a mistake regarding the relationship
between the two variables. There are two possible mistakes or errors. The
first is called a Type I error. This occurs when the researcher assumes that a
relationship exists when in fact the evidence is that it does not. In a Type I
error, the researcher should accept the null hypothesis and reject the research
hypothesis, but the opposite occurs. The probability of committing a Type I
error is called alpha.
The second is called a Type II error. This occurs when the researcher
assumes that a relationship does not exist when in fact the evidence is that it
does. In a Type II error, the researcher should reject the null hypothesis and
accept the research hypothesis, but the opposite occurs. The probability of
committing a Type II error is called beta.
Generally, reducing the possibility of committing a Type I error increases
the possibility of committing a Type II error and vice versa, reducing the
possibility of committing a Type II error increases the possibility of
committing a Type I error. Researchers generally try to minimize Type I
errors, because when a researcher assumes a relationship exists when one
really does not, things may be worse off than before. In Type II errors, the
researcher misses an opportunity to confirm that a relationship exists, but is
no worse off than before.
Example
: At a dental check up, the dentist tries to discriminate between
the hypothesis that your teeth are fine, and the hypothesis that you have one
or more cavities, on the basis of the data collected by clinical examination
and other investigations. These measurements are subject to certain level of
uncertainties. As a result, the dentist can make two kinds of errors—
concluding you have a cavity when you don’t or vice versa.
Null hypothesis
: You don’t have a cavity.
Alternate hypothesis
: You have one or more cavities.
Type I error
: It occurs if the dentist concludes you have a cavity, but you
do not.
Type II error
: It occurs, if the dentist concludes you don’t have a cavity,
when you really have one or more.
Select a probability of error level (alpha level)
:

=== PAGE 1041 ===
Researchers generally specify the probability of committing a Type I error
that they are willing to accept, i.e. the value of alpha. In the social sciences,
most researchers select an alpha = .05. This means that they are willing to
accept a probability of 5% of making a Type I error, of assuming a
relationship between two variables exists when it really does not. In research
involving public health, however, an alpha of .01 is not unusual. Researchers
do not want to have a probability of being wrong more than 0.1% of the time,
or one time in a thousand.
If the relationship between the two variables is strong (as assessed by a
Measure of Association), and the level chosen for alpha is .05, then moderate
or small sample sizes will detect it. As relationships get weaker, however,
and/or as the level of alpha gets smaller, larger sample sizes will be needed
for the research to reach statistical significance.

Parametric vs non-parametric tests
Choosing the right test to compare measurements is a bit tricky, as you must
choose between two families of tests—parametric and non-parametric. Many
statistical tests are blased upon the assumption that the data are sampled from
a Gaussian distribution. These tests are referred to as parametric tests. Tests
that do not make assumptions about the population distribution are referred to
as non-parametric tests. These tests usually rank the outcome variable from
low to high and then analyze the ranks.
How to choose
Choose a parametric test if you are sure that your data are sampled
from a population that follows Gaussian distribution.
The outcome is a rank or a score and the population is clearly not

=== PAGE 1043 ===
3.
Gaussian. For example, VAS scale, Apgar scale for new born babies,
then use non-parametric test.
Some values are too high or too low to measure, even if the population
is Gaussian, it is not advisable to use parametric test since we do not
know all values.
Significance of Choosing Parametric vs Non-Parametric
What happens when a parametric test is used for non-Gaussian distribution?
Parametric tests are robust to the deviations from Gaussian distribution, so as
long as the samples are large the effect might be camaflouged. 
What happens
when non-parametric test is used for a data from Gaussian population?
The p values tend to be a bit too large, but the discrepancy is small, in other
words, non-parametric tests are only slightly less powerful than parametric
tests with large samples. In case of small samples when the same parametric
test is used for non-Gaussian population, the p value becomes inaccurate.
P Value (one-/two-sided)
With many tests you must choose whether you wish to calculate one- or two-
sided P value. A one-sided P value is appropriate when you can state with
certainty that there will be no difference between the means or that the
difference will go in a direction you can specify in advance. If you cannot
specify the direction of any difference before collecting data, then a two-
sided P value is more appropriate. “If in doubt, select a two-sided P value”.
Paired or unpaired test
When comparing two groups, you need to decide whether to use a paired test.
When comparing three or more groups, the term paired is not apt and the
term repeated measures is used instead. Use an unpaired test to compare
groups when the individual values are not paired or matched with one
another. Select a paired or repeated measures test when values represent
repeated measurements on one subject or measurements on matched subjects.
The paired or repeated measures tests are also appropriate for repeated
laboratory experiments run at different times, each with its own control.
You should select a paired test when values in one group are more closely
correlated with a specific value in the other group than with random values in

=== PAGE 1044 ===
a.

the other group. It is only appropriate to select a paired test when the subjects
were matched or paired before the data were collected.
1. 
Standard error test for large samples
:
 A sample is considered to be
large when it has more than thirty observations. When the difference between
any two large sample in terms of means or proportion need to be tested the
formulas used are:
Standard error of difference between two means
where 
S
1
 and 
S
2
 are standard deviation of 2 samples and n
1
 and n
2
 are the
respective sample sizes.

Standard error of difference between 2 proportions
It is given by the formula
where 
P
 and 
Q
 are the proportion of 2 groups and 
n

 and 
n

 are the respective
sample sizes.
Chi square test
It is an alternate method of testing the significance of difference between two
proportions.
Test the null hypothesis

 Set up a null hypothesis that “there is no
difference between the two” and then proceed to test the hypothesis.

Standard error test for small samples
:
 A sample is considered to be
small, if it has less than 30 observations. The test applied is called the 
‘t’
 test.
When the investigation is in terms comparing the observations carried out
on the same individuals say before and after certain experiment, such
comparisons are called as paired comparisons, when the observations are
carried out in two independent samples and their values are compared, it is
known as unpaired comparison.
1
t-test for paired comparison
First the null hypothesis that the two sets of observations are not
different is set up.
The difference between the before and after experimentation readings
are calculated for each individual.
The mean and standard deviation(s) of these differences are calculated.
The standard error of this mean difference is calculated by the formula
S
 A/n.
t
 is calculated by the formula:
The degrees of freedom 
(df)
 for this calculation t is 
n
 – 1 where n is the
number of pairs of observation.
From t-distribution table, 
p
 is noted down corresponding to (n – 1) 
df
and then calculated value of 
t
.
If 
p
 is more than 0.05, the mean difference is insignificant and if 
p
 is
less than 0.05 the mean difference is significant.
The unpaired’t’ test
Set up the null hypothesis that the difference in two means is zero.
Calculate the means and standard deviations for the two groups
separately.

and 
n

samplesA standard error of the difference between the two means.
Compute the pooled degrees of freedom as n

 + n

 – 
2
.
Refer to the table of “t distribution” and find out the probability level 
P
corresponding to the above degrees of freedom and the calculated ‘t’.
Conclusions are made on the basis of this P.
Correlation
In order to find out whether there is significant association or not between
two variables (e.g. height and weight), we calculate the coefficient of
correlation which is represented by the symbol V and is calculated by the
formula
where 
x
 and 
y
 are the two variables and we have ‘n’ individuals with one
reading of × and one reading of y. The correlation coefficient 
r
 tends to lie
between –1.0 and +1.0. If 
r
 is near +1, it indicates a strong positive
association between × and y, i.e. when one variable increases the other
variable also increases. A value near –1 indicates a strong negative
association, i.e. when one variable increases the other decreases. If 
r
 = 0 it
indicates there is no association between 
X
 and 
Y
.
5. Reporting tests of statistical significance
9
In research reports, tests of statistical significance are reported in three ways.

=== PAGE 1047 ===

3.
4.
First, the results of the test may be reported in the textual discussion of the
results. Include:
The hypothesis
The test statistic used and its value
The degrees of freedom
The value for alpha (p-value)
A second method of reporting the results of tests for statistical
significance is to report the test and its value, the degrees of freedom, and the
p
-value at the bottom of the contingency table or printout showing the data on
which the calculations were based.
The third way to report tests of statistical significance is to include them
in tables showing the results of an extended analysis of the data, including a
number of variables.

=== PAGE 1048 ===
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
10
Research can be referred to as a careful investigation or inquiry specially
through search for new facts in any branch of knowledge. Redman and Mory
define research as “systematic effort to gain new knowledge. According to
Clifford Woody, research comprises defining and redefining problems,
formulating hypothesis or suggested solutions; collecting, organising and
evaluating data; making deductions and reaching conclusions; and at last
carefully testing the conclusions to determine whether they fit the formulating
hypothesis.

Objectives of Research
The purpose of research is to discover answers to questions through the
application of scientific procedures. The main aim of research is to find out
the truth which is hidden and which has not been discovered as yet.
To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to achieve new insights into
it (Exploratory or formulative research studies).
To portray accurately the characteristics of a particular individual,
situation or a group (Descriptive research studies).
To determine the frequency with which something occurs or with
which it is associated with something else (Diagnostic research).
To tort a hypothesis of a causal relationship between variables
(Hypothesis-testing research).

Types of Research
10
Descriptive vs. analytical research
: Descriptive research includes
surveys and fact-finding enquiries of different kinds. The major
purpose of descriptive research is description of the state of affairs as it
exists at present. Analytical research, on the other hand, to use facts or
information already available, and analyze these to make a critical
evaluation of the material.
Applied vs. fundamental
: Applied research aims at finding a solution
for an immediate problem facing a society or an industrial/business
organization. Fundamental research is mainly concerned with
generalizations and with the formulation of a theory.
Quantitative vs. qualitative
: Quantitative research is based on the
measurement of quantity or amount. It is applicable to phenomena that
can be expressed in terms of quantity. Qualitative research, on the other
hand is concerned with qualitative phenomenon, i.e. phenomena
relating to or involving quality or kind. For instance, “motivation
research” an important type of qualitative research.
Qualitative research is specialy important in the behavioural sciences
where the aim is to discover the underlying motives of human
behaviour.
Conceptual vs. empirical
: Conceptual research is that related to some
abstract idea(s) or theory. It is generally used by philosophers and
thinkers to develop new concepts or to reinterpret existing ones.
Empirical research relies on experience or observation alone, often
without due regard for system and theory.
One-time research or longitudinal research
: The research is confined
to a single time-period. Whereas in the latter case, the research is
carried on over several time periods.
Field-settling research or laboratory research or simulation research.
Clinical or diagnostic research.
Exploratory research.
Historical research.
Conclusion-oriented research

Definition of the research problem
:
 This could be formulated based on the
area of interest of the researcher or on what information is required at the
hour; could be a life-threatening epidemic or a chronic disease condition
burdening the health care system.
Technique involved in defining a problem
Statement of the problem in a general way
Understanding the nature of the problem
Surveying the available literature
Developing the ideas through discussions
Rephrasing the research problem
Review of literature
:
 As the saying goes “those who ignore or forget the
past are bound to repeat its mistakes”. A thorough review of the literature
(online and hand search) will make the researcher aware of the studies
already been conducted in the area of interest. Critically analyzing the
literature will avoid repeating same type of research or its mistakes; failing in
which will result in wasting money, manpower and time.
Developing a hypothesis
:
 It is the focal point in research. A hypothesis is
tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical and
empirical consequences. They not only have an effect on the type of data to
be collected but also on the analyzing and outcome measures.
Simple hypothesis
:
 It is that one in which there exists relationship
between two variables one is called independent variable or cause and other
is dependant variable or effect. For example:
Smoking leads to cancer
The higher ratio of unemployment leads to crimes
Complex hypothesis
:
 It is that one in which as relationship among
variables exists. In this type, dependant or independent variables are more
than two.
Smoking and chewing tobacco leads to cancer, tuberculosis, etc.
The higher the ratio of unemployment, poverty and illiteracy leads

=== PAGE 1053 ===
to crimes like dacoit, robbery, murder, etc.
Empirical hypothesis
:
 Working/empirical hypothesis is one which is
applied to a field. During the formulation, it is an assumption only but when
it is pat to a test become an empirical/working hypothesis.
Null hypothesis
:
 It is contrary to the positive statement of a working
hypothesis. According to null hypothesis, there is no relationship between
dependent and independent variable. It is denoted by HO.
Alternative hypothesis
:
 Firstly, many hypotheses are selected, then
among them select one which is more workable and most efficient. That
hypothesis is introduced latter on due to changes in the old formulated
hypothesis. It is denoted by HI.
Logical hypothesis
:
 It is that type in which hypothesis is verified
logically. JS Mill has given four cannons of these hypothesis, e.g. agreement,
disagreement, difference and residue.
Statistical hypothesis
:
 A hypothesis which can be verified statistically
called statistical hypothesis. The statement would be logical or illogical but if
statistic verifies it, it will be statistical hypothesis.
Deciding on a research design
:
 The first three steps in the research
process will greatly determine the research design. The main function is to
provide for the collection of relevant evidence with minimal expenditure of
effort, time and money.

DETERMINING SAMPLE DESIGN
10
Sampling can be defined as the investigation of part of a population, in order
to provide information, which can then be generalized to cover the whole
population.
Since we can seldom examine a whole population, we generally have to
settle for examining a part of it. When we select a portion of a population, we
refer to it as a sample. When we take a sample and study it, we want to be
able to draw general conclusions about the population. For example, if you
take a spoonful of ice-cream from a container and taste it, you will be able to
make a general statement about how much you like that kind of ice-cream.
You will have to taste a sample. You don’t have to eat the whole thing in
order to make an informed opinion.
In this case, the sample you tested is representative of the whole container
because the whole container is filled with the same icecream.
How we choose a sample is often as important as the size of the sample
we choose. Various sampling techniques have been developed which ensures
that representative samples are selected. Sampling is of 2 types—probability
sampling and non-probability sampling.
In probability sampling, the chance that an element in a target population
will be selected is known. As a result, the sample is representative of the
population.
In non-probability sampling, the chance that an element in a target
population will be selected in the sample is unknown or the sample is not
representative of the population.

Types of Sampling Techniques
Probability sampling
Non-probability sampling
Simple random
Accidental/convenience
Stratified random
Judgement/purposive
Systematic random
Network/snowball
Area/cluster sampling
Quota sampling
 
Dimensional sampling
 
Mixed sampling

=== PAGE 1058 ===
Probability Sampling
a. Simple Random Sampling
Every member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the
sample. This type of sampling is used when the population in homogenous.
There are several methods of achieving random selection, e.g. lottery method
(computer, roulette, table of random numbers).
Give numbers to all the persons, e.g. 00–99 every member has a chance
of being included in the sample as they are replaced after every draw.
b. Stratified Random Sampling
The sample is deliberately drawn in a systematic way so that each portion of
the sample represents a corresponding strata of the universe. The population
is heterogeneous. This method is useful when one is interested in analyzing
the data by a certain characteristic of population. For example, Hindus,
Christians, Muslims as these groups are not distributed equally in the
population.
In a sample size of 50; suppose the racial population distribution is as
follows:
Hindus = 300
Muslims = 100
Christians = 80
SC/ST = 20.
A proportionate stratified sampling would require 10 people be selected
from each group. A disproportionate sampling would mean the selection of
each stratum at a percentage. In this case N = 50 is 10% of N = 500.
i.e. 10% of 300 = 30:
10% of 100 = 10: 10% of 80 = 8: 10% of 20 = 2.
In case of SC/ST, the number 2 will be under representation.
c. Systematic Random Sampling
This process involves the selection of certain elements in a series according

=== PAGE 1059 ===
to predetermined sequence. To explain this we will take, e.g. to carry out a
gingivitis survey in a town, we can take 10% sample. The houses are
numbered firstly. Then a number is selected at random between 1 and 10 (say
5). Then every 10
th
 number is selected from the point on 5, i.e. 15, 25, 35, 45,
etc. By this method, each unit in the sampling frame would have the same
chance of being selected, but the number of possible samples is greatly
reduced. The population can be homogeneous or heterogeneous.
d. Area or Cluster Sampling
The cluster or area sample is particularly appropriate when a simple random
sample proves to be prohibitive in terms of travel, time and cost.
In a multistage random sampling, a large scale of survey is used. For
example, selected school, roll numbers, classes, etc.

=== PAGE 1060 ===
Non-Probability Sampling
a. Accidental or Convenience Sampling
One will not always be able to randomly sample from the population of
interest. You will have to examine the people you are able to contact or get
access to even though they are not representative of the population. They are
inexpensive and less time consuming.
b. Judgement or Purposive Sampling
This involves the selection of elements, which represent a typical sample
from a target population. When this approach is used, the quality of sample
selected depends on the accuracy of the researchers judgement of what
constitutes a typical sample.
c. Network or Snowball Sampling
This involves a multistage technique that utilizes social network of
individuals who tend to share common characteristics. The researcher must
first identify and interview a few subjects with requisite criteria. These
subjects are then asked to identify others with the same criteria. These
persons may be then asked to identify others until a satisfactory sample is
obtained.
This procedure is useful for finding subjects who may not be willing to
make themselves known in the population. For example, alcoholics, drug
addicts, child abusers, etc.
d. Quota Sampling
This procedure involves the selection of proportional samples of subgroups
within a target population to ensure generalization of findings. Quota
sampling ensures the inclusion of population subgroups that are likely to be
under represented. For example, racial minorities, elderly, poor and the very
rich.
e. Dimensional Sampling

=== PAGE 1061 ===
In this sampling technique, only a small sample is needed, since each selected
case will be examined in more detail.
f. Mixed Sampling Designs
Mixed sampling designs constitute the combination of both probability and
non-probability sampling procedures.

=== PAGE 1062 ===
Sampling Frame
A sampling frame is a listing of the members of the universe from which the
sample is to be drawn. The accuracy and completeness of the sampling frame
influence the quality of the sample drawn from it.
1
Sometimes a list of all individuals in the target population will be
available. For example, electoral register, age sex register in a health centre.
Such a list is known as sampling frame.

Sample Size
It depends upon the extent to which the sample population represents the
general population. Make the sample size as large as possible to ensure
adequate representation. A researcher should consider these factors.
Type of study (descriptive, experimental, etc.)
Variability of population (expressed as SD)
Number of variables (as variables increase sample size increase)
Level of precision (degree to which the sample population represents
the general population)
Sensitivity of measurement tools
Sampling method employed
Expected effect size (expected difference in scores)

Factors Governing Size of Sample

Sample must be large enough to allow sensible conclusions to be
drawn from it.

Use of Sampling
Sampling may be the only way to obtain information about a
population, because the true extent of the population is unknown, or
even if it were known access to the whole population is impossible.
The need to reduce labour and hence cost.
Savings in time, manpower and money.
Besides these, there are two important reasons why a sample should be
random. Firstly, a random sample will avoid bias, which is a systematic
tendency to overestimate or underestimate the population parameter.
Secondly, with a random sample statistical techniques can be used to make
probability statements about the population parameter. This is the basis of
significance tests and confidence intervals.
Collecting the Data
Primary data can be collected either through experiment or through survey. If
the researcher conducts an experiment, quantitative measurements are made.
For example, amount of demineralization of teeth measured by using
polarized light microscopy, the caries experience is measured by the number
of filled, decayed and missing teeth. But in case of a survey, data can be
collected by any one or more of the following ways: Observation, personal
interview, telephone interviews, mailed questionnaires.
Analysis of Data
The data collected from a survey or an experimental trial is called a raw data.
This further has to be subjected to coding, tabulation, in order to make it a
processed data, so that it can further be subjected to statistical analysis and
inference.
Raw data is transformed into useful and purposeful categories
Coding operation—categories are transformed into symbols that may
be tabulated and counted.
Editing—it improves the quality of the data for coding.
Tabulation—classified data are presented in tables.

Hypothesis Testing
10
,
13
After analyzing the data, the processed data is subjected to statistical tests
which will help to either accept the proposed hypothesis or vice versa. If the
researcher had no hypothesis to start with, generalizations established on the
basis of data may be stated as hypotheses to be tested by further researches.
Hypothesis and Study Design
Descriptive studies—the results obtained from this study will enable us
to formulate a hypothesis.
Analytical studies—the hypothesis proposed in the descriptive study
will be tested. The conclusion of such studies would be to accept or
reject null hypothesis.
Experimental studies—these are studies with high strength of evidence.
The inference regarding hypothesis testing drawn from analytical
studies are further strengthened by RCTs and other clinical trials,
which will serve as foundation for evidence-based practice.

Social sciences are defined as those disciplines committed to the scientific
examination of human behaviour.
Social sciences include
:
Sociology
Social anthropology
Social psychology
Economics
Political science
Sociology, social anthropology, social psychology are termed as
behavioural science.

SOCIOLOGY
Definition
Socious → companion or associated
Logus → science or study.
Sociology is defined as the study of human interactions and interrelations,
their conditions and consequences.

Sociology deals with the human relationships and of human behaviour for
a better understanding of the pattern of human life.

Social Group
Society is a group of individuals drawn together by a common bond of
nearness and who act together in general for the achievement of certain
common goals.
Different groups are needed for different purposes, these groups comprise
social organisation.

Family
Family is a primary unit in all societies. It is the most powerful example of
social cohesion. It is a group of biologically related individuals living
together and eating from a common kitchen. As a biological unit, the family
members share a pool of genes as a social unit, the family members share a
common physical and social environment. As a cultural unit, the family
reflects the culture of the wider society of which it forms a part and
determines the behaviour and attitudes of its members.
4
Types of Family
Nuclear family
:
 The nuclear or elementary family is universal in all
human societies. It consists of the married couple and their children
while they are still regarded as dependents.
Joint family
:
 The joint or extended family is a kind of family grouping
which is common in India, Africa, the Far East and the Middle East. It
is more common in agricultural areas than in urban areas. The orthodox
Hindu family in India is a joint family. As a price for education,
urbanization and industrialization, we are losing the joint family
system.
Three generation family
:
 It is common in the west. This tends to be a
household where there are representative of three generations. It occurs
usually when young couples are unable to find separate housing
accommodation and continue to live with their parents and have their
own children.

Community
From the time of birth until death, all normal human beings are part of a
group, the family or community. The characteristics of a community are:
The community is a contiguous geographic area.
It is composed of people living together.
People co-operate to satisfy their basic needs.
There are common organizations, e.g. markets, schools, stores, banks,
hospitals.
A community is a network of human relationships. It is a major
functioning unit of society.

Social Class
People in a community are differentiated by certain characteristic, which they
bear.
These may be
:
Personal characteristics such as age, sex, marital status, place of birth
and citizenship.
Economic characteristics such as occupation and type of activity.
Cultural characteristics such as language, religion and caste.
Educational characteristic such as literacy and level of education.
Social scientists have used occupation widely as a means of determining
the levels of social standings of an individual in a community, because
occupation has a enormous importance in all societies for understanding
human behaviour.
Occupation is a major determinant of
:
Economic rewards
: That is income and wealth which can promote or
achieve health easier.
Extent of authority
: Occupation is an important determinant of
authority which the individual has over other people; it spills over into
his life itself, his pleasures and other activities through control of
purchasing power. Those who receive higher economic rewards tend to
be vested with greater authority.
Extent of obligations
: The extent of obligations demanded of
individuals by the rest of the community will be determined by the
occupation he holds.
Degree of status
: Closely allied with the occupational role is the degree
of status and standing of the individual in the community. The
occupation itself will give the person status irrespective of personal
characters, age, and experience.
Values and lifestyles
: The occupation of an individual very largely will
determine many of the values the individual has, the things he feels
worth pursuing, his life goals, his lifestyle; his pleasures, friendships

and relationships with others.

Education
: It measures the inculation of values, knowledge and

Types of Workers
Skilled
:
 Skilled employee is one who is capable of working independently
and efficiently and turning out accurate working. He must be capable of
reading and working on simple drawing circuits and process, if necessary,
e.g. electrician, mechanic, tailor.
Semi-skilled
:
 Semi-skilled employee is one who has sufficient knowledge of
the particular trade or above to do respective work and simple job with the
help of simple tools and machines, e.g. asst. operator, asst. electrician.
Un-skilled worker
 is one who possesses no special training and whose work
involves the performance of the simple duties which require the exercise of
little or no independent judgement or previous experience although a
familiarity with the occupational environment is necessary, e.g. chowkidar,
watchman, cleaner, sweeper.

Socioeconomic Status Scale
1
Assessment of socioeconomic status (SES) is an important aspect in
community based studies. Evaluation of SES of a family would mean the
categorization of the family in respect of defined variables such as education,
occupation, economic status, physical assets, social position, etc.
The socioeconomic status (SES) is an important determinant of health
and nutritional status as well as of mortality and morbidity. Socioeconomic
status also influences the accessibility, affordability, acceptability and actual
utilization of various available health facilities. There have been several
attempts to develop different scales to measure the socioeconomic status. The
earliest attempts to find out the social class of an individual were from the
standpoint of psychologists.
Hollingshed
 in USA employed three variables, i.e. education, occupation
and residential address for measuring socioeconomic status. In Indian studies,
the classification of British Registrar General based on occupation was tried
earlier. Later on Prasad’s classification of 1961 based on per capita monthly
income and later modified in 1968 and 1970 has been extensively used.
Nowadays Kuppuswamy scale is widely used to measure the socioeconomic
status of an individual in urban community based on three variables namely
education, occupation and income (
Table 23.1
).
Modified version of the Kuppuswamy’s socioeconomic status scale for
the year 2007 is given in

Attitude to Disease
The attitude of people to health and disease varies in different social classes.
Upper Middle Class
The members of this class include the professional, business and executive
group living in preferred areas and well-maintained homes. They seek out
expert advice and in areas where they feel it is important, follow the advice
with considerable religiosity.
They value their teeth, are interested in preventive dentistry and actively
pursue various types of dental care. The dentist is visualized as a professional
who not only repairs teeth but also prevents decay and loss of teeth and
makes a person teeth more attractive and useful. The members have the
desire to have their own teeth for as long as possible.
Lower Middle Class
The members of this class include owners of small business, minor
executives, teachers, salesmen and white-collar workers.
The dentist is regarded as an authority who fixes teeth. They are the most
compulsive in their dental care attitudes. The dentist is considered as one who
give directions as to how teeth should be cared for and who is useful for
preventive dentistry. Dental health habits are began early and followed with
persistence.
Upper Lower Class
This class includes skilled and semiskilled blue-collar workers. They are
people of limited education; they are law-abiding respectable, hard-working
citizens.
They are resigned to whatever happens and feel there is little they can do
to stance off the inevitable, including the loss of their teeth. They receive
artificial dentures at a relatively early age and are happy with them.
Selfmedication based on popular notions interests them. They instruct their
children how to care for their teeth, but the children are more or less on their
own after that.

=== PAGE 1087 ===
They are happy receiving care from a clinic than from individual
practitioner. They acquire confidence in the reputation of the clinic because
the clinic was started by a well-known agency and in part because they see
their friends there. This can be called as “clinic habit”.
Lower Class
It consists of unskilled labourers, people who quit from job-to-job, have
limited education, live in slum areas and exhibit no stable pattern of life.
They reveal the most consistent neglect of teeth and they require careful
understanding if they are to receive adequate care in public health facilities.

SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
Definition
Psychology
:
 Psychology is defined as “the study of human behaviour—of
how people behave and why they behave in just the way they do”.
1
Social psychology
:
 It is concerned with the psychology of individuals
living in human society or groups.
The emphasis is on understanding the basis for perception, thought,
opinion, attitudes, general motivation and learning in individuals and how
these vary in human societies and groups.
It deals with the effect of social environment on persons, their attitudes
and motivation.

=== PAGE 1089 ===
Emotions
An emotion is a strong feeling of the whole organism. Emotions motivate
human behaviour. An emotional experience is characterized by both external
and internal changes. The external changes are those, which are apparent and
easily seen by other such as changes in facial expression. The internal
changes brought about by emotions are psychological such as rapid pulse,
respiration, and increased blood pressure. 
2
 Some of the major emotions are:
Fear
Jealousy
Sympathy
Anger
Moodiness
Pity
Love
Joy
Lust
Hate
Sorrow
Grief

=== PAGE 1090 ===
i.
ii.
Motivation
It is a inner face which drives an individual to a certain action. It also
determines human behaviour. Motivation is concerned with the factors that
stimulate or inhibit the desire to engage in behaviour.
Motivation may be
:
Positive Negative
Extrinsic Intrinsic
Extrinsic motivation refers to rewards that are obtained not from the
activity, but as a consequence of the activity. This motivation arises from the
use of external rewards or bribes such as food, praise, free time, money or
points toward an activity.
Intrinsic motivation refers to rewards provided by an activity itself. The
motivation arises from internal factors such as a child’s natural feeling of
curiosity, exigent, confidence and satisfaction when performing a task.
People who are involved in a task because of intrinsic motivation appear to
be engaged and even consumed, since they are motivated by the activity itself
and not some goal that is achieved at the end or as a result of the activity.
Positive motivation is often more successful than negative motivation.
Motivation is not manipulation. A motivated person acts willingly and
knowingly. Motivation is contagious, it spreads from one motivated person to
another, we make use of motives and incentives in community health work.

Personality
It implies certain physical and mental traits which are characteristic of a
given individual, there traits determine to some extent, the individual’s
behaviour or adjustment to his surroundings.
3
Components of Personality
There are four components of human personality. They are:
Physical
:
 These are physical traits of an individual namely, height,
weight, colour, facial expression, etc.
Emotional
:
 Emotions are the feelings we have fear, anger, love,
jealousy, guilt, worries.
Intelligence
:
 Personality also implies intellectual ability.
Behaviour
:
 Behaviour is a reflection of one’s personality.
Development of Personality
Infancy
:
 The first one year of life is infancy.
Preschool child
:
 This stage is marked by considerable growth of brain.
He begins to mix with other small children.
School age
:
 The school age period ranges from 5 to 15 years. By the
age of 8, the mental powers are fully developed. There is gradual
detachment from the family, and greater attachment to his playmates
and friends.
Adolescence
:
 Adolescence or “teenage” is a turbulent period in one’s
life. This is a period of rosy dreams, adventure, love and romance. The
teenager strives for independence.
Adults
:
 The person is mature and more balanced. The physical and
mental characteristics are fully developed.
Old age
:
 Old age is marked by certain psychological changes such as
impaired memory, rigidity of outlook, irritability, bitterness, inner
withdrawal and social maladjustment.
Thinking

=== PAGE 1092 ===
a.
b.
c.
d.
Thinking is the base of all cognitive activities or processes and is unique to
human beings. Thinking is organised and goal directed. It involves
manipulation and analysis of existing information received from the
environment. Such manipulation and analysis occur by means of abstracting,
reasoning, imagining, problem solving, judging, and decision-making.
Thinking includes perception, memory, imagination and reasoning. The
highest form of thinking is said to be creative thinking, e.g. an artist painting
a picture.
1
Problem Solving
An aspect of thinking is problem solving. It is regarded as the highest stage in
human learning. Some problems in life are relatively simple, there are other
which are more difficult and complex calling for thinking and reasoning.
Reasoning requires intelligence.
Intelligence
It is the ability to see meaningful relationships between things. It includes
perceiving, knowing, reasoning and remembering.
2
Mental Age
Binet and Simon devised the first tests of intelligence. They developed the
concept of mental age.
Gessel indicated four sectors of intellectual development for consideration:
Motor ability
Adoptive behaviour
Language development
Personal-Social behaviour
Intelligence Quotient
It is obtained by dividing the mental age by chronological age, and
multiplying by 100.

Anthropology is the study of the physical, social and cultural history of
man.
Physical
:
 The study of human evolution,
racial difference, inheritance of bodily traits, growth and decay of human
organisms is called physical anthropology.
Social
:
 The study of the development and various types of social life is
called social anthropology.
Cultural
:
 The study of the total way of life of contemporary primitive
man, his ways of thinking, feeling and action is called cultural
anthropology.
Medical
:
 It deals with the cultural component in the ecology of health
and disease.

Social Scientist
The public health worker is very dependent upon the group behaviour of
individuals, when he embarks on community programme. He faces difficulty
in programme planning and implementation due to strong influence of
cultural background.
During the last decade, social scientists have been called upon to aid in
adapting new health programmes to existing cultural patterns.
Functions
Programme planning and evaluation.
Public health experiments.
Estimation of indigence’s.

Social Worker
They are experts with special training in:
Appraising personal and family economic problems.
Organising sensible patterns for health care, education and home life.
They are needed where multiple problems exist, such as combination
of low income, loss of parents, physical disability or mental illness.
The social worker can help the public health dentist in appraising the
accessibility of low-income patients to health care facilities.

=== PAGE 1097 ===
Conclusion
Social sciences have brought to the field of public health, the study of
psychology, culture and other aspects of human behaviour, which are as
important a part of our environment as the physical environment. The
contribution, experiments and reports of social scientists and social workers
should be watched with interest by the dental profession and their assistance
sought in programme design, development, implementation and evaluation.

Behaviour Management
Behaviour management is as much a clinical skill as it is a science. It is
meant to develop a relationship between doctor and patient which ultimately
builds trust and diminishes fear and anxiety.
Successful dentistry for children depends not only upon the dentists
technical skills, but also upon his ability to acquire and maintain a child’s co-
operation.
The management of a child’s behaviour begins the moment the child
enters the dental clinic and continues until the child leaves.

Communication
The first objective in the successful management of the young child is to
establish communication. Communication establishes a relationship with the
child and may help the child to develop a positive attitude towards dental
care.
2
I. Verbal
Style of conversation
:
 The wordings have to be natural, comfortable
and relaxing. One should speak to gain the child’s attention.
Matter of conversation
:
 One should try to know the patient prior to the
treatment, in the sense that:
Call the patient by name
Compliment the patients dress
Ask about hobbies, friends, etc.
Choice of words
:
 The words you choose to speak to the child should
not cause fear to the child.
Words should be in level with the IQ of the child.
Rubber dam—rain coat/umbrella
Alginate—pudding
Voice control
:
 Voice control is controlled alteration of voice, volume,
tone or pace to influence and direct a patient’s behaviour.
II. Non-verbal
Give him a smiling face.
Walk with him/her around the clinic holding his/her hand-foot on the
shoulder, show some pictures.

=== PAGE 1102 ===

Eye contact: It should show—admiration, encouragement, friendliness.
Children are very sensitive to facial expressions.

BEHAVIOUR MODIFICATION/SHAPING
It is that procedure which very slowly develops behaviour by reinforcing
successive approximations of the desired behaviour until the desired
behaviour comes to be.
3
It is a method of teaching the child step by step what is expected from
him in the dental operation.
The ingredients involved in behaviour shaping are:
Systematic desensitisation
Tell, show, do
Modelling
Contingency management
Distraction

=== PAGE 1104 ===
1. Systematic Desensitisation
This technique was introduced in the year 1957 by Joseph Wolfe. He
introduced this method to eliminate fear and apprehension.
Here we teach the child step by step to adopt from one behaviour to
another, i.e. we mould the child from a slight stimuli then gradually increase
to a severe stimuli.
4
This technique helps individuals with specific fears or phobias overcome
them by repeated contacts. A hierarchy of fear-producing stimuli is
constructed with patient input and the patient is then exposed to these fear-
producing stimuli in an ordered manner, starting with the stimulus posing the
lowest threat. In dental terms, fears are usually related to a specific procedure
such as the use of local anaesthetic. First, the patient is taught to relax, and in
this state exposed to each of the stimuli in the hierarchy in turn, only
progressing to the next when they feel able. The technique is useful for a
child who can clearly identify their fear and who can verbally communicate.

=== PAGE 1105 ===
2. Tell, Show, Do
This technique is widely used to familiarize a patient with a new procedure
and to reduce the anxiety of the child. The ‘tell’ phase involves an age
appropriate explanation of the procedure. The ‘show’ phase is used to
demonstrate the procedure, for example, demonstrating with a slow
handpiece on a finger. The ‘do’ phase is initiated with a minimum delay, in
this case a polish. The technique is useful for all patients who can
communicate. There are no contraindications.
As soon as the child enters the reception area show him/her the
surroundings, take him/her inside the clinic. Start showing from the minimal
fear promoting object to severe fear promoting object. Show him/her the
mechanism of moving the chair, allow him/her to switch on the light. This
reduces the anxiety of the child.
2

=== PAGE 1106 ===
3. Modelling
This technique is based on the psychological principle that people learn about
their environment by observing the behaviour of others. This can be achieved
by using a model, either live or by video, who exhibits the appropriate
behaviour in the dental environment. This technique may decrease the target
child’s anxiety by showing a positive outcome following a procedure that the
target child requires themselves and will also illustrate the rewards for
appropriate behaviour. For best effects, models should be the same age as the
target child, should exhibit appropriate behaviour and be praised. They
should also be shown entering and leaving the surgery. The technique is
likely to be useful for all patients. There are no contraindications. Modelling
is exhibiting desired or appropriate adaptive behaviour to the child to
overcome his fear.
4
 For example, another child being treated in the same
clinic.

=== PAGE 1107 ===
a.

4. Contingency Management
Contingency management is based on the principle that behaviour is a
function of its consequences. That is, what people do—how they behave—is
related in a predictable way to the consequences of their behaviour. For
example, if an action is followed by a positive consequence (positive for that
person), then the individual is likely to repeat that action. In contrast, if an
action is followed by a negative consequence (negative for that person), then
the individual is unlikely to repeat the action.
It is of two types:
Positive
Negative
Positive reinforcement
 is a response that follows a behaviour and has the
effect of increasing the likelihood of that behaviour occurring again—by
providing a positive experience as a consequence. Examples: Giving a child
food or a toy, child praise or a hug. Generally creates a more positive
learning and communication environment. The limitation is when the child
feels that the reinforcement is meaningless or childish the actual results of
reinforcement may be the opposite of their intended results.
Negative reinforcement
 is the strengthening of a pattern of behaviour by
the removal of a stimulus which the individual perceives as unpleasant (a
negative reinforcer) as soon as the required behaviour is exhibited. The
stimulus is applied to all actions except the required one, thus reinforcing it
by removal of a negative stimulus. A well-known example of negative
reinforcement in dental practice is selective exclusion of the parent. When in
appropriate behaviour is exhibited the parent is asked to leave. When
appropriate behaviour is exhibited the parent is asked to return, thus
reinforcing that behaviour. Good practice for this technique includes gaining
specific informed consent for the technique and the parent should be able to
hear, but be out of sight of, the child.

=== PAGE 1108 ===
5. Distraction
This approach aims to shift the patient’s attention from the dental setting to
some other situation or from a potentially unpleasant procedure to some other
action. Cartoons have been shown to reduce disruptive behaviours in children
when combined with reinforcement, which is when children knew the cartoon
would be switched off, if they did not behave. This reinforcement technique
is also effective with audio distraction. However, audio distraction, although
proven effective for adults, has been shown to have variable success in
children. Verbal distraction, e.g. the dentist who talks while applying topical
paste and administering local anaesthetic, can also be effective. The
technique is useful for all patients who can communicate.

BEHAVIOUR MANAGEMENT INGREDIENTS
Ingredients of behaviour management include:
Biofeedback
Voice control
Coping
Humour
Relaxation
Audio analgesia
Hypnosis
Implosion therapy
Aversive conditioning
Drug therapy.

=== PAGE 1110 ===
1. Biofeedback
This helps in the self-controlled relief from pain. Process that can be
controlled by biofeedback includes EMG activity (electromyographs, tension,
headaches, heart rate, blood pressure). The physiologic function to be
controlled must be monitored continuously and the monitoring device must
be sensitive to detect any minute changes which are feedback to the subjects.
2

=== PAGE 1111 ===
2. Voice Control
The voice should be soft, gentle, modulated. Make the child secure by your
voice. Make the child realize that you are his friend. You should increase or
decrease according to need of the patient. Young children especially may
often respond to tone of voice rather than the actual words. Such techniques
aim to improve attention and compliance as well as to establish authority; e.g.
an abrupt change from soft to loud to gain attention of a child who is not
complying. Voice control has been shown to decrease disruptive behaviours
without producing long-term negative effects. While reported as widely used
by dentists. However, it is not appropriate for children too young to
understand or with intellectual or emotional impairment.

=== PAGE 1112 ===
3. Coping
Patients differ not only in their perception and response to pain but also in
their ways of dealing or coping with stress associated with painful
experiences.
Cognitively based coping strategies appear to be more efficacious in older
children with younger children benefitting more so from coping strategies
which offer emotional support. Older children show more coping behaviour
when staff or parents make coping promoting statements. Examples of these
coping behaviours include relaxation and rationalisation.

=== PAGE 1113 ===
4. Humour
One should be humorous to elevate the mood of the child which helps the
child to relax.

=== PAGE 1114 ===
5. Relaxation
This technique is used to reduce stress and is based on the principle of
elimination of anxiety. Relaxation of the patient helps in reducing the
reaction to pain and in reducing anxiety present.
Snoezelen environment consists of a partially dimmed room with lighting
effects, vibroacoustic stimuli and deep pressure. Shapiro et al. demonstrated
that a snoezelen environment had a positive effect on children. The technique
is useful for all patients including those who cannot verbally communicate.
There are no contraindications

=== PAGE 1115 ===
6. Audio Analgesia
The use of pleasant music has been used to reduce stress and also decrease
the reaction to pain. Audio analgesia diverts the attention of the patient and
patient starts relaxing which would be beneficial to the dentist.

=== PAGE 1116 ===
1.

3.
7. Hypnosis
Hypnosis is an artificially induced altered state of consciousness in which the
individual becomes more susceptible to suggestion. The technique is useful
for all patients who can verbally communicate. Dentists are advised to
receive training in hypnosis.
The use of hypnosis in dentistry is termed as hypnodontics. One great
benefit of hypnosis is to reduce anxiety in the patient.
Clinical features include
:
Closed eyelid begins to flutter.
Breathing becomes deeper.
There is a progressive sense of relaxation.

=== PAGE 1117 ===
8. Implosion Therapy
This refers to the picturization of animated movies to the child, e.g. wild life.

9. Aversive Conditioning
This method is usually used for a child who displays negative behaviour and
does not respond. Here we use physical restraints.
3
Physical restraints include
:
Use of mouth props
Mouth prop is used at the time of administration of local
anaesthesia to prevent child from closing mouth.
Used in handicapped children.
Used in young children who cannot keep their mouth open for
extended periods of time.
For example, of mouth prop is MOLT mouth prop.
Restraint of the patient by dentist and dental assistant
This involves the restriction of the movement of child’s hands
and feet or body.
The assistant must be trained to control the child’s hands, head,
body, etc.
For example, for a radiograph, the child can be made to sit on
parent’s lap.
Home
It is also known as hand over mouth exercise.
This comes under avasive conditioning.
The home has been used to re-establish communication with the child.
Procedure
The dentists hand is placed over the child’s mouth to muffle the noise.

10. Drug Therapy
If a child does not respond to either psychologic or physical management
procedure, then drug therapy is required. Premedicative agents could be used.
Very young children.
Very apprehensive children.
Physically handicapped children.
Mentally handicapped.
Drugs used
:
Sedative and hypnotics
: Chloralhydrate and barbiturates
Antianxiety drugs
: Diazepam, promethazine
Narcotics
: Meperidine Combination of these drugs is also used.
General Anaesthesia
It is a controlled state of unconsciousness accompanied by a loss of
protective reflexes. It is done in an hospital setting to render dental care. This
can be a life-threatening procedure, hence its use should be restricted only to
specific causes.

=== PAGE 1120 ===
Conclusion
The rendering of necessary dental care to children is very rewarding.
Behaviour management when used judiciously can result in the most
satisfying of all results. Desensitization, modelling, contingency management
techniques have been found useful by the behaviour therapists and in the
dentist office. Application of these techniques, separately or in combination
will frequently enable the dentist to elicit successively more appropriate
behaviour.

Cultural Taboos
in Dentistry
Since time immemorial, the teeth, the mouth and the face have held a
seemingly intrinsic fascination for mankind. They have been and continue to
be the subject of many oral and written beliefs, superstitions, and traditions
and the object of a wide range of decorative and mutilatory practices. At the
same time, they have been the cause of considerable suffering for many.

=== PAGE 1123 ===
CULTURE
Culture is defined as “Learned behaviour which has been socially acquired”.
1
Anthropologists have provided many definitions, the most famous being
Tylor’s definition
 in 1871 ‘that complex whole which includes knowledge,
belief, morals, art, law custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired
by man as a member of society’.
2
Cultural factors in health and disease have engaged the attention of
medical scientists and sociologists. Every culture has its own customs which
may have significant influence on health and oral health.

ROLE OF CULTURE AND RELIGION ON ORAL
HEALTH
3
Different cultures influence the way in which a person will respond to illness
and the treatment. Culture may influence a matrix of elements.
The way in which illness and disease and their causes are perceived by
the patient.
The behaviour of patients and their attitudes towards healthcare
providers.
The delivery of services by the providers who may not appreciate or
understand the cultural traditions and requirements of the patient.
The patient’s belief system with regard to health, well-being and
healing.

=== PAGE 1125 ===
MUTILATIONS OF TEETH
In the modern world, body decoration and mutilation is universal in its
occurrence and is observed among people in all regions of the developed and
underdeveloped world. Tooth-related and oral soft tissue mutilations are well-
recognized forms of mutilation.
7
A knowledge of these practices is important for the valuable insights they
provide into the cultural beliefs and traditions of the people who practise
them and for the very pragmatic reason that many comprise examples of
customs which directly give rise to pathology of the teeth and orofacial
tissues.
An understanding of these customs is important for diagnosis and
treatment of complications arising from these acquired forms of pathology.
Many of the dental and orofacial mutilations have relatively specific features
and patterns reflecting different ethnic or tribal affiliations. Aknowledge of
these customs is also important in the context of forensic odontology.

Tooth Mutilations
Tooth mutilation practices have been recorded for inhabitants of non-tropical
environments, but most of these customs are observed among people living in
the tropical regions of the world.
These practices include non-therapeutic tooth extraction (evulsion); the
breaking off of tooth crowns; alteration in the shape of the tooth crowns by
filing and chipping, dental inlay work; lacquering and staining of teeth; and
miscellaneous practices such as the placement of gold crowns for adornment
purposes.
Reasons for Tooth Mutilations
Basic themes such as initiation identification, and aesthetics underlie many of
the mutilation customs encountered throughout the tropics. Beliefs and
associations ascribed to the practice of tooth evulsions are as follows:
Tribal identification
Initiation rite
Sign of manhood or bravery
Differentiation of sexes
Sign of marriageable age in females
Sign of ceremonial rebirth
To ensure a life after death
Aesthetics and fashion
Therapeutic purposes
Sign of mourning
Sign of subjugation
Form of punishment
Cultural mimicry
To enable an individual to spit properly
Local superstition associated with phenomena such as rain.
A number of people ascribed prophylactic benefit to certain root

mutilation customs. For example, Mosha (1983)
4
 describes the removal of the
permanent mandibular central incisors among the Iraq, Waarusha, and Masai
people of Tanzania. Over half of the individuals who had submitted to this
procedure indicated that the space left following removal of these teeth
provided a route allowing passage of fluids in the event of a person becoming
ill and being unable to open his or her mouth (due to tetanus—lock jaw).
The enucleation of unerupted deciduous teeth has been described by
Pindborg (1969),
5
 which appears to be confined to certain regions of Africa
including Northern Nigeria and Tanzania, is considered to confer therapeutic
benefit upon children. Among Nigerian tribes, the practice of deciduous
canine (usually mandibular) germinectomy is considered to guard against
symptoms such as high fever which may be associated with teething in
children. In this area of Africa, parents take their children, suffering from
fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, to local ‘doctors’ who advise the removal of
the lower deciduous tooth germs. The reason given by these ‘doctors’ for the
enucleation of the teeth is that the symptoms suffered by the child are due to
a new type of tooth, namely the ‘nylon tooth’ which grows in children’s jaws
and which, if not removed, will cause death. The term ‘nylon tooth’
apparently has been invented by the ‘doctor’s to describe the clinical
appearance of the enucleated tooth germs which have a white, glistening
appearance.
The practice of blackening the teeth among the Jivaro Indian people of
Northern Peru and Ecuador, is a custom carried out in order to prevent dental
caries. Tooth lacquering and dyeing is a custom performed in several other
countries of the world including Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philippines. While aesthetics is the usual motive for this practice, it is
possible that the custom has an unintended caries-preventive effect.

Tooth Evulsion
Tooth evulsion describes the deliberate removal of a tooth for ritual or
traditional purposes. The various motives underlying tooth evulsion usually
have a non-therapeutic basis.
Reasons for Tooth Evulsion
In general terms, ritual tooth evulsion is carried out for reasons of
identification, religious-spiritual reasons, to signify some life event, such as
the transition from childhood to manhood or womanhood, or for aesthetics
and fashion.
Number and Type of Teeth Involved
The Atayal people of Taiwan are reported to extract their ‘back teeth’ for
aesthetic purpose. The number of teeth extracted for reasons for ritual or
custom is usually between one and four. However, examples of the evulsion
of more than four teeth in one jaw and the extraction of total or more than
four teeth in both the jaws are recorded. Among some people, tooth evulsion
may be carried out in association with other tooth mutilation practices such as
chipping and filing.
Age and Sex Distribution
The age at which ritual tooth evulsions are performed varies. Clearly,
procedures involving deciduous teeth are carried out on persons in their
infancy or childhood. Evulsion of permanent teeth may be carried out at any
age from childhood onwards. However, in general, permanent tooth evulsion
tends to be performed on individuals in their late, childhood-teenage years. In
some cultures, the practice of tooth evulsion is associated with events such as
puberty and initiation rites in males or the time of first menstruation or
marriage in females.
Methods of Tooth Evulsion
In majority of cultures where tooth evulsion is performed, the tooth or teeth
are knocked out rather than extracted. This is usually carried out by placing a
piece of wood or metal against the labial aspect of the tooth crown and then

=== PAGE 1129 ===
striking the end of this object, from the appropriate direction, with some form
of mallet. The latter may comprise a stone, a piece of rock, the back of an
axe, or some other suitable instrument. Teeth may be completely evulsed by
this method or loosened sufficiently to allow removal using the fingers.
The relative positions of operator and patient during tooth evulsion vary.
The patient may be seated, but more commonly, lies on the ground. When the
patient is in the latter position the operator may sit at the head of the patient,
sometimes cradling the patient’s head on the lap, and remove the tooth by
working from behind the patient. In other instances, the operator may work
from the front of the patient by either straddling the prone patient or by
crouching at the side of the patient.
3
Pain relieving or anaesthetic measures are not routinely prescribed
preoperatively, during the operation, or postoperatively. The operation does
cause considerable suffering and mental anguish for the patients.
Following tooth evulsion, attempts to control postoperative haemorrhage
may be employed. Finger pressure on the socket, the use of a hot twig applied
to the wound, and application of a variety of plant materials such as twigs and
leaves which are believed to have styptic properties.
Complications following Tooth Evulsion and
Germinectomy
Dentoalveolar complications include alveolar bone fracture, damage to
mucosal tissues, and fracture of the tooth crown leaving the tooth root in situ.
Complications could also include gross wound sepsis, periapical
granuloma, abscess formation, pulp necrosis and bacterial infestation of the
root canal.
Complications following deciduous tooth removal are wound sepsis,
haemorrhage and extensive soft tissue laceration.
Fate of Evulsed Teeth
Great care is sometimes taken to dispose of evulsed teeth in an appropriate
manner. In some tribes, the teeth were buried by ceremonial fire, kept as
charms, or sent to members of other tirbes. In central Australia, Aboriginal
tribe pounded the evulsed teeth into fragments which were then placed in a

=== PAGE 1130 ===
piece of meat.
1
 If the tooth had been removed from a female then the
pulverized tooth was eaten by girls mother. In case of a male, the tooth was
eaten by his mother-in-law. Other customs include embedding of evulsed
teeth in the bark of a tree, burying of the teeth beside water pool, throwing
the extracted teeth into water and throwing the tooth as far as possible
towards a legendary camp-site.

=== PAGE 1131 ===
1.
Mutilations of the Tooth Crown
Mutilations of tooth crown includes alteration in shape or appearance of
teeth. The alteration of the shape or appearance of tooth crown are done by
chipping and filing, dyeing and lacquering of teeth, decoration of the tooth
crown by inlays, overlays, etc. The custom of altering tooth crown shape is
confined to anterior teeth (canine-to-canine) of the upper and lower jaws.
Reasons for Altering the Shape of Teeth
The reasons include aesthetics, tribal identity, initiation rituals, religious
motives and identification with animals. Peacock recorded that many of the
people who submitted to customs such as flattening of incisal surfaces,
grinding of incisors to gum level, etc. were ignorant of the reason why they
were done. The usual answer being “It is the law of the old people, sir”.
According to village headman, this practice related to the belief that at death
all people enter a purgatory and undergo a trial of chewing green bamboo. If
a person’s teeth are sharp, then the bamboo is likely to splinter and pierce the
mouth and intestine. If the teeth are smooth, the bamboo can be chewed
without ill effects.
Number and Type of Teeth Involved
Two to twelve permanent anterior teeth are the most commonly involved.
The teeth most affected by these procedures are the central and lateral
incisors of each jaw and also the canines.
Age and Sex Distribution
Tooth crown mutilations such as chipping and filing are carried out in the late
childhood and teenage years. Tooth chipping and filing may be performed on
both male and female members of the society.
Patterns of Chipping and Tooth Filing
In general, the various forms of chipping and filing of the tooth crown
primarily involve mutilation of:
Incisal edge.

=== PAGE 1132 ===
2.
3.
4.
5.
a.
The mesial and/or distal incisal angle.
The mesial or distal surface.
The labial face.
The whole tooth crown.
Incisal edge mutilation may involve horizontal flattening of the incisal
surface such that the length of the tooth crown is shortened.
Methods of Chipping and Filing
The operations producing deformations generally involve a process of
chipping away enamel and dentin with some form of chisel and mallet until
the desired shape is achieved.
The instrument used as the chisel is generally a metal instrument such as
knife or axehead. The mallet with which the chisel is struck may be a
hammer, the back of an axehead or stone.
The operation is undertaken by having the patient sit or lie on the ground
with their head on the operator’s lap. Patients may be restrained by having
their head clamped between the operator’s knees or by being held by other
individuals. Prior to chipping of the teeth, a piece of wood is placed between
the molar teeth to act as a form of retractor to keep the lips and tongue out of
the way. The teeth are then chiselled to the desired shape. The chipped teeth
may be left as they are or subjected to a secondary process of smoothening
using a file or abrasive stone. It could take from few hours to several weeks.
The custom performed on children involves the sawing off of the tooth
crowns of the six maxillary anterior teeth using a hack-saw blade or paddy
knife.
Complications of Tooth Chipping and Filing
Immediate complications associated with chipping and filing of tooth crowns
include severe pain, unintended tooth fracture, pulp exposure, laceration of
oral soft tissues. Occasionally, children suffered fatal haemorrhage or “went
out of their minds” as a result of the operation.
Delayed complications include
:
Pulp necrosis producing non-vital teeth

Inflammatory periapical pathology
Sequelae of periapical pathology (cellulitis, osteomyelitis)
Caries
Tooth loss
Lacquering and Dyeing of Teeth
Extensive staining of the erupted tooth crown can be a consequence of a
variety of causes. These include poor oral hygiene, habits such as tobacco
smoking and chewing, betel usage, application of stains and dyes to tooth
crown. The blackening of teeth using an iron-containing mixture applied to
the tooth surface was custom practiced in ancient Japan.
1
The blackening of tooth was primarily used to signify marriage and
fidelity in marriage and for aesthetic reasons. Among some people, the
principal purpose appears to be related to concepts of beauty and sexual
appeal or maturity. In Vietnam, tooth lacquering is used for cosmetic
purposes. Some people blacken their teeth to help prevent tooth decay.
Staining of teeth is usually accomplished by chewing the leaves or bark of
specific plant species. The custom of lacquering teeth involves a process of
preconditioning or etching of the enamel surface, followed by the application
of appropriate staining lacquering agents. People recorded that lacquering
involved the etching of enamel for two days using lemon juice followed by
the application of black paints, ginger and mango. Other techniques include
the use of iron-containing mixtures, shellac and spices such as cloves,
cinnamon and pomegranate peel.
Decorative dental inlays and crowns
The use of dental inlays and crowns for adornment purposes is a form of non-
therapeutic tooth mutilation occasionally encountered among contemporary
peoples within and outside the tropics. In general, these practices are usually
carried out for purposes of beautification, to signifying wealth or to signify
some event.
7
 The nature of inlay materials used are haematite, jade, pyrite,
torquoise, obsidian and gold. The practice of placing decorative inlays in
front teeth was also carried out in India in previous times. The teeth of
Maharajahs were reportedly inlaid with glass or pearls. The dyaks of Borneo
are reported to drill small holes into the labial surface of the maxillary teeth

=== PAGE 1134 ===
and place pieces of copper in variously shaped defects. In the modern world,
the use of gold crowns on teeth is related to a therapeutic need to replace lost
or damaged dental tissues.
Among muslims, the presence of a gold crown (cap) on a front tooth is
used to signify that the wearer has visited mecca, the spiritual centre of that
religion.

=== PAGE 1135 ===
MUTILATIONS OF SOFT TISSUES
Tattooing
Tattooing of soft tissues is a practice which remains relatively popular in
many nontropical and tropical areas of the world. While tattooing of the skin
is the most commonly encountered expression of this practice, tattooing of
the lip and gingiva is occasionally seen.
The gingiva may be tattooed when females reach puberty, become
betrothed, or when they become married. It is practiced by men to relieve the
pain associated with ‘diseased gums’. It is believed that gingival tattooing has
therapeutic benefit.
6
The technique of gingival tattooing involves painting the gingiva with a
layer of pigmented material usually carbon which is then impregnated into
the gingival mucosa by means of sharp thorns nor needles which pierce the
mucosa. A blue black colouration is the usual hue achieved with gingival
tattoos. The material used to tattoo the gingiva may be obtained from
calcified peanuts, burned wood or from lamp black (the black soot obtained
from burning oil lamp). A tattooed lower lip in a Sudanese woman signifies
that the woman is married. Facial tattoos may incorporate a triangular-shaped
tattoo on the skin surface at the angle of mouth. It has its basis in ritual
warding off of the “evil eye”.

Other Forms of Soft Tissue Mutilation
A variety of other mutilation practices having their basis in ritual or custom
and involving orofacial soft tissues occasionally may be encountered among
people in tropical regions.
These include:
Piercing of lips and perioral soft tissues and the insertion of materials
such as wood, ivory or metal.
The temporary piercing of orofacial soft tissues for ceremonial
purposes.
Uvulectomy.
Facial scarring.
The best known example of temporary mutilation of soft and perioral soft
tissues is that practiced by Hindu men in India. During the ceremony of the
Thapasyam (Penace-white; Thaipusam), men in a state of apparently
selfinduced trance pierce the skin of the body with a variety of sharp weight-
bearing hoops and lances.
2
 The person gives no signs of experiencing pain
and the wounds do not bleed. Facial soft tissues are often subjected to
scarification. Scarification may be carried out for a variety of reasons
including tribal identity, aesthetics, to enhance sexual appeal, to indicate
status and to signify events such as puberty, marriage or childbirth.

Conclusion
The developed and under developed regions of the tropics comprise a vast
repository of beliefs and knowledge concerning health, disease and treatment.
In some instances, these knowledge have been retained for hundreds of years.
Awareness of them is important for those who are involved in the treatment
of patients and for those involved in the planning of dental health care
delivery system.
This awareness is important in the context of:
Sensitive approach and respect for cultural belief by those treating
patients according to modern methods and by those planning dental
care delivery system.
Giving thought to the incorporation of local beliefs and practices.
Convincing people of the harmful effects of some practices.
Those involved in providing dental care and professional dental education
should identify the cultural practices involving the teeth and oral soft tissues.

CHAPTER
26
Oral Health Care
for Special Groups
A compromised individual is a person who has one or more physical,
medical, mental or emotional problems that result in a limitation of that
person’s ability to function normally in fulfilling the activities of daily
living.
2
Although some of the causative factors for these compromised conditions
such as trauma, birth defects, or adult onset diseases allow impairment
patterns to appear along age stratification lines, the age of the individual per
se must not be the main determining factor in deciding the quality and
quantity of preventive dental instruction provided for that persons. Instead,
this decision should be made after consideration of a number of other factors,
including the individuals cognitive abilities, sensory perception, functional
expertise, and oral hygiene condition.

=== PAGE 1140 ===
Sensory Capabilities
Communication channels are impeded, if the patient’s hearing of vision is
significantly impaired, in which case a modification in communication
modalities must be made. Otherwise recommendations for an oral-health
home care programme will not be understood much less carried out.

=== PAGE 1141 ===
Visual Deficits
A number of aetiologies, from harmful prenatal and perinatal environments to
the normal aging process can lead to alteration in visual acuity. These
changes may range from correctable deficiencies to total blindness. Other
common visual deficits include a loss of peripheral vision as occurs with
glaucoma or visual field cuts resulting from a cerebrovascular accident.
Instructional materials to be used with patients who have decreased visual
acuity could include selective use of commercial products that have been
developed for pedodontic programmes. Routinely such products have large
pictures. Custom-made instructional sheets may be produced by the dental
office using large black letters of at least 12-point type on off-white or white
paper. The use of cassette tape for recording personalized hygiene
instructions is recommended chairside instructions of toothbrushing and
flossing should be demonstrated with a giant-sized tootbrush. These large
models allow the patients with limited visual acuity to see and to understand
some of the more subtle aspects of the toothbrushing, such as the correct
angulation of the bristles into the gingival crevice. A green-coloured floss can
help when demonstrating flossing to those with visual impairment who have
difficulty seeing the conventional white floss. Red floss is also available and
can be used; in fact, red is a colour that is visualized by the aging eye better
than green. While coloured floss is useful for demonstrations. Once the
flossing technique is understood and visual acuity permits, the patient may
switch to white floss for regular home use. This change allows the patient to
continually check the colour of the floss for possible gingival bleeding.
2
To demonstrate brushing and flossing techniques in the office, an
inexpensive magnifying mirror should be employed to assist the patient in
observing his or her own performance. A similar mirror should be
recommended for the patient’s use at home. If a patient has visual problems
so significant that a mirror cannot be used, the individual must be sensitized
instead to the “feeling” and “smell” of a clean mouth to attest to the success
of oral hygiene measures.

=== PAGE 1142 ===
Hearing Disabilities
The commonest problem in communicating with the hearing disabled is that
the provider does not sit directly in front of the patient and at the same eye
level, speaking face-to-face. The hearing disable patients rely heavily on the
communicator’s facial expression and body language to understand the
message. Therefore, speaking distinctly with a slightly decreased rate of
speed. Without exaggeration and in a well-modulated voice facilitates
intercommunication. One should avoid any back lighting that places the
speaker’s face in a shadow. Shouting should never be used with the hearing
disable patients since it is actually more difficult for the impaired ear to
understand. Speaking to the patient with any equipment running is
contraindicated. Similarly, it is not desirable to speak while performing other
functions, such as writing while the head is down, looking at radiographs
with the face turned from the patient or while entering or leaving the room
2
.
Pantomime and demonstration may be necessary when working with the
hearing disabled. Once the message is transmitted, it is expedient to have the
patient demonstrate the suggested oral hygiene skills on models followed by
demonstration in his or her own mouth. Suggest to the patient that hearing aid
be removed or turned off prior to treatment and replaced or turned back on
prior to receiving instructions.

=== PAGE 1143 ===
Speech and Languages Disorders
One cannot discuss the role of communication between the patient and the
provider without considering speech and language. It is a good idea when
dealing with such an individual to frame questions in such a way that they
can be answered with a “yes” or a “no” or even just a shake of the head. One
solution is to provide the patient with lap board containing preprinted letters,
common words, or pictures. Individuals with a knowledge of language but an
inability to speak or to have their speech or writing understood, can point to
the letters or words or pictures to communicate.

=== PAGE 1144 ===
Cognitive Capacities
The cognitive capacity of a patient is of far greater importance than a
person’s intelligence quotient (IQ) test results in determining the capability of
a individual to benefit from preventive dentistry instructions. To attain
success, the dental care provider must first determine the level of congnitive
ability of the patient and then direct all instruction to that level. If it is
determined that the patient has intellectual or cognitive impairment, the
traditional educational programme used to convey preventive oral hygiene
techniques must be modified. For example, it should be recognized the
brushing the teeth is a complex task that needs to be broken down into very
simple but discrete steps. This allows the impaired patient to follow the
instructions and to succeed at every step of the way toward the final goal,
thereby integrating the simple tasks into a final complex task. At the first
appointment, it may be possible to address only the brushing of the occlusal
surfaces of the teeth to achieve satisfactory compliance and to reinforce only
this activity until it becomes a natural part of the patient’s daily repertoire.
Reinforcement throughout the learning period should be supplemented with
both verbal and nonverbal rewards; for example, a smile or a gift of a new
toothbrush are often motivating techniques.

=== PAGE 1145 ===
Functional Performance
An accurate assessment of a patient’s expected functional performance
depends upon the evaluation of each of the separate tasks necessary to
complete the oral hygiene task. Once the difficulty has been identified, it then
requires either a device of a luman to compensate for a patient’s inadequacy.
Gross motor skills, such as grasping a tooth brush handle, can often be
improved by orthotic appliances specifically the electric toothbrush may
serve as a highly effective substitute for this lack of dexterity.

=== PAGE 1146 ===
Attendant Care
There will be many compromised individuals who will be unable to handle
their own hygiene due to sensory, cognitive, or physical deficits. For these
individuals, an attendant or family member should be instructed in the proper
oral health care for the patient. If a patient has tender, friable gingival tissue
that can easily become damaged by an initially dry toothbrush, the brush can
be pre-wet to soften it. The elimination of the toothpaste increases visibility
and decreases the possibility of gagging. Those patients who enjoy the taste
or appreciate the aesthetic value of toothpaste can use a non-foaming
ingestible toothpaste developed for the astronauts. Since this toothpaste does
not foam and can be swallowed, it is not necessary for the patient to be near a
basin to expectorate.
If a patient would like to rinse his or her mouth after brushing with water
or a mouth wash, a two-paper cup technique can be used. One paper cup
holds the rinse, the other is for the expectorate after the patient was swished
the rinse around. Since the cups are lightweight, patients can often hold both,
bringing each of the cusps up to their lips as they are needed. This two-cup
technique provides a mean to control dribbling or drooling. This technique is
valuable for an individual who is unable to lean over the basin such as an
arthritic patient or for an individual who cannot pursue the lips to expect the
fluid as is the case with muscular dystrophy.

PREGNANCY
It is a common belief that every pregnancy invites the loss of a tooth by the
mother. Pregnancy has no direct causation of tooth loss, but there are a
number of factors which influences the rapidity and progression of incipient
or already well-established oral disease. The expectant mother may be
involved in a multitude of extra activities. During this time, her own oral care
may be neglected both with regard to home care and also visits to the dentist.
There may be a change in eating habits, with an increased intake in
carbohydrates, sweets and candies which may coincide with a desire for
bizarre or exotic foods.
The factors responsible for dental caries may be listed as follows
:
Diet
:
 The expectant mother may have her cravings for sugary drinks or
sweets, or other cariogenic foods.
Home care
:
 In view of the extra plaque which may form because of the
increased sucrose intake, there should be more scrupulous brushing.
Other factors
:
 Acid attack in the plaque may be accelerated by acid
from the stomach from nausea occurring early in some pregnancies.
Gingival disease can be quite significant during pregnancy. There are
hormonal changes at this time, so that any mild inflammation (which
otherwise may not be detected) may become quite marked sometimes with
grossly enlarged and bleeding gingivae.
1
Isolated enlargements may relate to the papillae of one or two teeth and
these may interfere with eating because of bleeding. Although termed
pregnancy ‘tumours’ these are composed of inflammatory tissue and should
eventually resolve with the removal of the irritants, but occasionally surgery
is required for complete return to normal. These conditions do not occur
where there has been careful plaque control from the beginning. Therefore, it
is necessary to go over brushing and other home care methods with such
patients and to stress the importance of paying particular attention to the
regions where bleeding is experienced.

=== PAGE 1148 ===

Preventive Attention for the Expectant Mother
The dentist should be attended as early as possible in the first stages of
pregnancy for a thorough examination so that all the necessary treatment can
be carried out well in advance. Advice should be given on a suitable diet to
be adopted both to protect the parent and the developing child. Apart from
the usual sensible mixed diet of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, essentially
the mother’s diet should include all the proteins, minerals, and vitamins
which the fetus need.
An adequate daily intake of milk or milk products.
Proteins—meat, eggs, fish, poultry.
Vegetables—greens, cabbage, sprouts, etc. for vitamin A and iron.
Citrus fruits—oranges, lemons, grape fruit. etc. for vitamin C.
The expectant mother should be careful to avoid taking tetracycline
antibiotics; otherwise there would be a danger of discoloured teeth in the
child.

THE NEW BABY
Breastfeeding, if possible, of the newborn child is preferable to bottle-feeding
for the following reasons:
The maternal milk contains immune factors which have been acquired
by the mother against various diseases so that the child has built-in
resistance to such disease for the first few weeks of life.
The milk contains all the balanced nutrients.
The act of sucking on the breast is of importance to the proper
development of the jaws. The action of the tongue and the pressure of
the jaws and lips are enhanced by the effort made by the child to obtain
the milk. All too often the bottles used do not give this pressure and the
milk may be obtained too easily with resulting lack of stimulation of
jaw growth. If, however, for some reason the mother finds it
impossible to breastfeed the baby, the bottle must be chosen from the
number of well-designed feeding bottles which stimulate the action of
the breast. The mother should be warned against purchasing a teat with
a large hole or enlarging the existing hole with a pin in order to satisfy
the impatient child. Too easy sucking may lead to ‘tongue thrusting’
and developmental errors.
1

=== PAGE 1150 ===
THE HANDICAPPED CHILD
Special consideration must be given to the handicapped child (or adult),
although it should be borne in mind that more often than not the patient will
not be as conscious of the handicap as the operator. However, handicapped
patients require more time, thought and care in oral hygiene training and
many of them will need more efficient plaque removal than their more
fortunate contemporaries. The following handicap categories are considered:
Oral
Cleft palate, mucosal lesion, cleft lip, etc.
Heart
Congenital
 
Rheumatic (acquired)
Senses
Blindess
 
Deafness
Limbs
Arm movements defective
 
Leg movements defective
Mental
Continuous—retardation, defects emotional, psychic
Periodic
Petit mal
 
Grand mal

=== PAGE 1151 ===
Oral Lesions
For the patient with cleft palate, it is essential to use all preventive measures
possible to preserve the remaining teeth. Efforts should be made to avoid
extractions, as both deciduous and permanent teeth are needed for retention
or stabilization for any appliances. Therefore, appointments for preventive
care should be frequent, and the intervals between recall should be short.
Some parents initially may reject the deformity, and therefore, avoid the
necessary cleaning of the mouth. It may be that they fear doing harm to an
area which appears to be already damaged. Thus, to avoid neglect for
whatever reason, the patients must be told of the importance of home care
and its bearing on future success. Later it will be necessary to demonstrate
effective cleaning of any obturator or appliance.
1
Cleft lip is usually repaired at a very early stage and, therefore, presents
little problem except that before repair there are feeding problems which
require advice and assistance.

=== PAGE 1152 ===
Congenital Heart Disease
Here exceptional oral hygiene control is imperative, with antibiotic cover for
all procedures which might provoke bacteraemia. Increase of antibiotic
dosage may be necessary during dentistry for those already on regular
maintenance antibiotic therapy.
Rheumatic heart disease requires the same considerations as above, and
these patients are more likely to be on permanent antibiotic cover. The risk
for all these heart patients is, of course, the possibility of bacterial
endocarditis. All septic areas should be removed under suitable
chemotherapy cover. The successful handling of these cases will depend on a
careful history, records and a close cooperation with the patient’s physician at
all times.

=== PAGE 1153 ===
Senses—Deafness
The deaf will benefit by visual aids and carefully written instruction sheets
for home reading. An intermediary who uses finger sign language may help
to solve their communication problem.

=== PAGE 1154 ===
Blindness
The blind will benefit by use of large tactile teaching aids such as models
with large tooth brushes will help considerably. Cassette tapes may also be
prepared and given for home use.

=== PAGE 1155 ===
Defective Limb Movements
This calls for assistance of a third party or in lesser handicaps the use of
various aids such as automatic brushes, floss holders, ‘perio aids’ may be
tried, probably successively until one suitable for the patient is discovered.

=== PAGE 1156 ===
Mental Handicaps
For those on phenytoin to control epileptic seizures, it is essential to teach or
somehow to ensure plaque control to avoid the tendency for gross
enlargement of the gingiva. There is no doubt that this will not occur in the
100% clean mouth. Mentally retarded patients may require a great deal of
patience to overcome fears of the dentist’s environment. Therefore, the
approach must be gradual and in terms the patient can cope with. Restraint
may have to be used occasionally and it is better not to use drugs. The
brushing and other oral care may be best accomplished by nurses or other
personnel, if the patient is hospitalized. The value of preventive measures is
soon appreciated in the growing confidence of the patient and the reduction
in the amount of restorative work which may be traumatic for such patients.
1

=== PAGE 1157 ===
Leukaemia
Careful oral cleansing with as much freedom from trauma as possible is
essential with leukaemics; often antibiotic cover is required. No extraction
should be carried out without very special precautions and it is better to refer
the child to a hospital.

=== PAGE 1158 ===
Conclusion
Individuals with physical, medical, mental, or emotional problems often have
a greater need for dental care than their healthy counterparts. This may be
because the disability itself has oral manifestations, but more commonly, it is
due to (1) the limited capabilities of the individual or the family members to
understand and to perform important oral hygiene tasks, (2) a lack of
understanding of the importance of preventive dental care, (3) a lack of
ability to finance dental care. When the compromised patient does present to
a dental office, the main essentials will be the preservation of the teeth, the
avoidance of major operative interference and primary prevention from the
earliest possible moment in order to prevent the onset of destructive disease.

Tools of measurement in epidemiology are:
Rates and ratios
Rates, ratios and proportions
Rates and proportions
Ratios and proportions
If there had been 3,000 new cases of dental caries in a population
of 30,000 in a year, then the incidence rate would be:
50 per 1,000 per year
100 per 1,000
100 per 1,000 per year
50 per 1,000
The relationship between prevalence and incidence is:
P = I × D
I = P × D
P = I/D
P = D/I
If the incidence rate is 10 cases per 1,000 population per year and
the mean duration of disease is 5 years, then the prevalence is:
50 per 1,000 population
500 per 1,000 population
25 per 1,000 population
100 per 1,000 population
Observing the distribution of disease or health-related
characteristics in human population with respect to time, place and

Acknowledgements
I owe my passion for the subject to the wonderful students I have had during
my academic career and it is one such student’s influence, the reason for the
preparation of the third edition. I acknowledge my humble gratitude and
sincere thanks.
Many ideas presented in this book were from colleagues in the field of
public health dentistry. It is their constant support without whom this book
would not have been a success.
A special commendation for the contributors of this book who gave their
time and efforts and we acknowledge them with our deep gratitude for their
generosity.
I would like to express my gratitude to the many people who saw me
through this book; to all those who provided support, talked things over, read,
wrote, offered comments, allowed me to quote their remarks and assisted in
the editing, proofreading and design.
My special thanks to Dr Mahesh Verma, for penning the foreword and to
Dr Swati Shourie, for initiating the process.
We would like to thank Mr S.K. Jain (CMD), Mr. Varun Jain (Director),
Mr. YN Arjuna (Senior Vice President – Publishing and Editorial), and Mr.
Ashish Dixit (Business Head – Digital Publishing, Marketing & Sales) and
his team at CBS Publishers & Distributors Pvt. Ltd. for their skill,
enthusiasm, support, patience and excellent professional approach in
producing and publishing this eBook.
A special thanks to Dr Jayshree, Dr Vyshiali, Dr Shivashankar, Dr Nazia
and Dr Mageswari.
Above all I want to thank my wife, and the rest of my family, who
supported and encouraged me in spite of all the time it took me away from
them. It was a long and difficult journey for them.
Last but not the least I beg forgiveness of all those who have been with
me over the course of the years and whose names I have failed to mention.
